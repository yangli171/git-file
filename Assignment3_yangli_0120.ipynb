       "['The Princess LyricsPROLOGUE\\n\\nSir Walter Vivian all a summer\\'s day\\nGave his broad lawns until the set of sun\\nUp to the people: thither flocked at noon\\nHis tenants, wife and child, and thither half\\nThe neighbouring borough with their Institute\\nOf which he was the patron. I was there\\nFrom college, visiting the son,--the son\\nA Walter too,--with others of our set,\\nFive others: we were seven at Vivian-place.\\nAnd me that morning Walter showed the house,\\nGreek, set with busts: from vases in the hall\\nFlowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,\\nGrew side by side; and on the pavement lay\\nCarved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,\\nHuge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;\\nAnd on the tables every clime and age\\nJumbled together; celts and calumets,\\nClaymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans\\nOf sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,\\nLaborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,\\nThe cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs\\nFrom the isles of palm: and higher on the walls,\\nBetwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,\\nHis own forefathers\\' arms and armour hung.\\n\\nAnd \\'this\\' he said \\'was Hugh\\'s at Agincourt;\\nAnd that was old Sir Ralph\\'s at Ascalon:\\nA good knight he! we keep a chronicle\\nWith all about him\\'--which he brought, and I\\nDived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,\\nHalf-legend, half-historic, counts and kings\\nWho laid about them at their wills and died;\\nAnd mixt with these, a lady, one that armed\\nHer own fair head, and sallying through the gate,\\nHad beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.\\n\\'O miracle of women,\\' said the book,\\n\\'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged\\nBy this wild king to force her to his wish,\\nNor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier\\'s death,\\nBut now when all was lost or seemed as lost--\\nHer stature more than mortal in the burst\\nOf sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--\\nBrake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,\\nAnd, falling on them like a thunderbolt,\\nShe trampled some beneath her horses\\' heels,\\nAnd some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,\\nAnd some were pushed with lances from the rock,\\nAnd part were drowned within the whirling brook:\\nO miracle of noble womanhood!\\'\\n\\nSo sang the gallant glorious chronicle;\\nAnd, I all rapt in this, \\'Come out,\\' he said,\\n\\'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth\\nAnd sister Lilia with the rest.\\' We went\\n(I kept the book and had my finger in it)\\nDown through the park: strange was the sight to me;\\nFor all the sloping pasture murmured, sown\\nWith happy faces and with holiday.\\nThere moved the multitude, a thousand heads:\\nThe patient leaders of their Institute\\nTaught them with facts. One reared a font of stone\\nAnd drew, from butts of water on the slope,\\nThe fountain of the moment, playing, now\\nA twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,\\nOr steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball\\nDanced like a wisp: and somewhat lower down\\nA man with knobs and wires and vials fired\\nA cannon: Echo answered in her sleep\\nFrom hollow fields: and here were telescopes\\nFor azure views; and there a group of girls\\nIn circle waited, whom the electric shock\\nDislinked with shrieks and laughter: round the lake\\nA little clock-work steamer paddling plied\\nAnd shook the lilies: perched about the knolls\\nA dozen angry models jetted steam:\\nA petty railway ran: a fire-balloon\\nRose gem-like up before the dusky groves\\nAnd dropt a fairy parachute and past:\\nAnd there through twenty posts of telegraph\\nThey flashed a saucy message to and fro\\nBetween the mimic stations; so that sport\\nWent hand in hand with Science; otherwhere\\nPure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled\\nAnd stumped the wicket; babies rolled about\\nLike tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids\\nArranged a country dance, and flew through light\\nAnd shadow, while the twangling violin\\nStruck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead\\nThe broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime\\nMade noise with bees and breeze from end to end.\\nStrange was the sight and smacking of the time;\\nAnd long we gazed, but satiated at length\\nCame to the ruins. High-arched and ivy-claspt,\\nOf finest Gothic lighter than a fire,\\nThrough one wide chasm of time and frost they gave\\nThe park, the crowd, the house; but all within\\nThe sward was trim as any garden lawn:\\nAnd here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,\\nAnd Lilia with the rest, and lady friends\\nFrom neighbour seats: and there was Ralph himself,\\nA broken statue propt against the wall,\\nAs gay as any. Lilia, wild with sport,\\nHalf child half woman as she was, had wound\\nA scarf of orange round the stony helm,\\nAnd robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,\\nThat made the old warrior from his ivied nook\\nGlow like a sunbeam: near his tomb a feast\\nShone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,\\nAnd there we joined them: then the maiden Aunt\\nTook this fair day for text, and from it preached\\nAn universal culture for the crowd,\\nAnd all things great; but we, unworthier, told\\nOf college: he had climbed across the spikes,\\nAnd he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,\\nAnd he had breathed the Proctor\\'s dogs; and one\\nDiscussed his tutor, rough to common men,\\nBut honeying at the whisper of a lord;\\nAnd one the Master, as a rogue in grain\\nVeneered with sanctimonious theory.\\nBut while they talked, above their heads I saw\\nThe feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought\\nMy book to mind: and opening this I read\\nOf old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang\\nWith tilt and tourney; then the tale of her\\nThat drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,\\nAnd much I praised her nobleness, and \\'Where,\\'\\nAsked Walter, patting Lilia\\'s head (she lay\\nBeside him) \\'lives there such a woman now?\\'\\n\\nQuick answered Lilia \\'There are thousands now\\nSuch women, but convention beats them down:\\nIt is but bringing up; no more than that:\\nYou men have done it: how I hate you all!\\nAh, were I something great! I wish I were\\nSome might poetess, I would shame you then,\\nThat love to keep us children! O I wish\\nThat I were some great princess, I would build\\nFar off from men a college like a man\\'s,\\nAnd I would teach them all that men are taught;\\nWe are twice as quick!\\' And here she shook aside\\nThe hand that played the patron with her curls.\\n\\nAnd one said smiling \\'Pretty were the sight\\nIf our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt\\nWith prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,\\nAnd sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.\\nI think they should not wear our rusty gowns,\\nBut move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph\\nWho shines so in the corner; yet I fear,\\nIf there were many Lilias in the brood,\\nHowever deep you might embower the nest,\\nSome boy would spy it.\\'\\nAt this upon the sward\\nShe tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:\\n\\'That\\'s your light way; but I would make it death\\nFor any male thing but to peep at us.\\'\\n\\nPetulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;\\nA rosebud set with little wilful thorns,\\nAnd sweet as English air could make her, she:\\nBut Walter hailed a score of names upon her,\\nAnd \\'petty Ogress\\', and \\'ungrateful Puss\\',\\nAnd swore he longed at college, only longed,\\nAll else was well, for she-society.\\nThey boated and they cricketed; they talked\\nAt wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;\\nThey lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;\\nThey rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,\\nAnd caught the blossom of the flying terms,\\nBut missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,\\nThe little hearth-flower Lilia. Thus he spoke,\\nPart banter, part affection.\\n\\'True,\\' she said,\\n\\'We doubt not that. O yes, you missed us much.\\nI\\'ll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.\\'\\n\\nShe held it out; and as a parrot turns\\nUp through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,\\nAnd takes a lady\\'s finger with all care,\\nAnd bites it for true heart and not for harm,\\nSo he with Lilia\\'s. Daintily she shrieked\\nAnd wrung it. \\'Doubt my word again!\\' he said.\\n\\'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:\\nWe seven stayed at Christmas up to read;\\nAnd there we took one tutor as to read:\\nThe hard-grained Muses of the cube and square\\nWere out of season: never man, I think,\\nSo mouldered in a sinecure as he:\\nFor while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,\\nAnd our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,\\nWe did but talk you over, pledge you all\\nIn wassail; often, like as many girls--\\nSick for the hollies and the yews of home--\\nAs many little trifling Lilias--played\\nCharades and riddles as at Christmas here,\\nAnd ~what\\'s my thought~ and ~when~ and ~where~ and ~how~,\\nAs here at Christmas.\\'\\nShe remembered that:\\nA pleasant game, she thought: she liked it more\\nThan magic music, forfeits, all the rest.\\nBut these--what kind of tales did men tell men,\\nShe wondered, by themselves?\\nA half-disdain\\nPerched on the pouted blossom of her lips:\\nAnd Walter nodded at me; \\'~He~ began,\\nThe rest would follow, each in turn; and so\\nWe forged a sevenfold story. Kind? what kind?\\nChimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,\\nSeven-headed monsters only made to kill\\nTime by the fire in winter.\\'\\n\\'Kill him now,\\nThe tyrant! kill him in the summer too,\\'\\nSaid Lilia; \\'Why not now?\\' the maiden Aunt.\\n\\'Why not a summer\\'s as a winter\\'s tale?\\nA tale for summer as befits the time,\\nAnd something it should be to suit the place,\\nHeroic, for a hero lies beneath,\\nGrave, solemn!\\'\\nWalter warped his mouth at this\\nTo something so mock-solemn, that I laughed\\nAnd Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth\\nAn echo like a ghostly woodpecker,\\nHid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt\\n(A little sense of wrong had touched her face\\nWith colour) turned to me with \\'As you will;\\nHeroic if you will, or what you will,\\nOr be yourself you hero if you will.\\'\\n\\n\\'Take Lilia, then, for heroine\\' clamoured he,\\n\\'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,\\nGrand, epic, homicidal; and be you\\nThe Prince to win her!\\'\\n\\'Then follow me, the Prince,\\'\\nI answered, \\'each be hero in his turn!\\nSeven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--\\nHeroic seems our Princess as required--\\nBut something made to suit with Time and place,\\nA Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,\\nA talk of college and of ladies\\' rights,\\nA feudal knight in silken masquerade,\\nAnd, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments\\nFor which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--\\nThis ~were~ a medley! we should have him back\\nWho told the \"Winter\\'s tale\" to do it for us.\\nNo matter: we will say whatever comes.\\nAnd let the ladies sing us, if they will,\\nFrom time to time, some ballad or a song\\nTo give us breathing-space.\\'\\nSo I began,\\nAnd the rest followed: and the women sang\\nBetween the rougher voices of the men,\\nLike linnets in the pauses of the wind:\\nAnd here I give the story and the songs.\\n\\nI\\n\\nA prince I was, blue-eyed, and fair in face,\\nOf temper amorous, as the first of May,\\nWith lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl,\\nFor on my cradle shone the Northern star.\\n\\nThere lived an ancient legend in our house.\\nSome sorcerer, whom a far-off grandsire burnt\\nBecause he cast no shadow, had foretold,\\nDying, that none of all our blood should know\\nThe shadow from the substance, and that one\\nShould come to fight with shadows and to fall.\\nFor so, my mother said, the story ran.\\nAnd, truly, waking dreams were, more or less,\\nAn old and strange affection of the house.\\nMyself too had weird seizures, Heaven knows what:\\nOn a sudden in the midst of men and day,\\nAnd while I walked and talked as heretofore,\\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts,\\nAnd feel myself the shadow of a dream.\\nOur great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane,\\nAnd pawed his beard, and muttered \\'catalepsy\\'.\\nMy mother pitying made a thousand prayers;\\nMy mother was as mild as any saint,\\nHalf-canonized by all that looked on her,\\nSo gracious was her tact and tenderness:\\nBut my good father thought a king a king;\\nHe cared not for the affection of the house;\\nHe held his sceptre like a pedant\\'s wand\\nTo lash offence, and with long arms and hands\\nReached out, and picked offenders from the mass\\nFor judgment.\\nNow it chanced that I had been,\\nWhile life was yet in bud and blade, bethrothed\\nTo one, a neighbouring Princess: she to me\\nWas proxy-wedded with a bootless calf\\nAt eight years old; and still from time to time\\nCame murmurs of her beauty from the South,\\nAnd of her brethren, youths of puissance;\\nAnd still I wore her picture by my heart,\\nAnd one dark tress; and all around them both\\nSweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen.\\n\\nBut when the days drew nigh that I should wed,\\nMy father sent ambassadors with furs\\nAnd jewels, gifts, to fetch her: these brought back\\nA present, a great labour of the loom;\\nAnd therewithal an answer vague as wind:\\nBesides, they saw the king; he took the gifts;\\nHe said there was a compact; that was true:\\nBut then she had a will; was he to blame?\\nAnd maiden fancies; loved to live alone\\nAmong her women; certain, would not wed.\\n\\nThat morning in the presence room I stood\\nWith Cyril and with Florian, my two friends:\\nThe first, a gentleman of broken means\\n(His father\\'s fault) but given to starts and bursts\\nOf revel; and the last, my other heart,\\nAnd almost my half-self, for still we moved\\nTogether, twinned as horse\\'s ear and eye.\\n\\nNow, while they spake, I saw my father\\'s face\\nGrow long and troubled like a rising moon,\\nInflamed with wrath: he started on his feet,\\nTore the king\\'s letter, snowed it down, and rent\\nThe wonder of the loom through warp and woof\\nFrom skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware\\nThat he would send a hundred thousand men,\\nAnd bring her in a whirlwind: then he chewed\\nThe thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen,\\nCommuning with his captains of the war.\\n\\nAt last I spoke. \\'My father, let me go.\\nIt cannot be but some gross error lies\\nIn this report, this answer of a king,\\nWhom all men rate as kind and hospitable:\\nOr, maybe, I myself, my bride once seen,\\nWhate\\'er my grief to find her less than fame,\\nMay rue the bargain made.\\' And Florian said:\\n\\'I have a sister at the foreign court,\\nWho moves about the Princess; she, you know,\\nWho wedded with a nobleman from thence:\\nHe, dying lately, left her, as I hear,\\nThe lady of three castles in that land:\\nThrough her this matter might be sifted clean.\\'\\nAnd Cyril whispered: \\'Take me with you too.\\'\\nThen laughing \\'what, if these weird seizures come\\nUpon you in those lands, and no one near\\nTo point you out the shadow from the truth!\\nTake me: I\\'ll serve you better in a strait;\\nI grate on rusty hinges here:\\' but \\'No!\\'\\nRoared the rough king, \\'you shall not; we ourself\\nWill crush her pretty maiden fancies dead\\nIn iron gauntlets: break the council up.\\'\\n\\nBut when the council broke, I rose and past\\nThrough the wild woods that hung about the town;\\nFound a still place, and plucked her likeness out;\\nLaid it on flowers, and watched it lying bathed\\nIn the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees:\\nWhat were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?\\nProud looked the lips: but while I meditated\\nA wind arose and rushed upon the South,\\nAnd shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks\\nOf the wild woods together; and a Voice\\nWent with it, \\'Follow, follow, thou shalt win.\\'\\n\\nThen, ere the silver sickle of that month\\nBecame her golden shield, I stole from court\\nWith Cyril and with Florian, unperceived,\\nCat-footed through the town and half in dread\\nTo hear my father\\'s clamour at our backs\\nWith Ho! from some bay-window shake the night;\\nBut all was quiet: from the bastioned walls\\nLike threaded spiders, one by one, we dropt,\\nAnd flying reached the frontier: then we crost\\nTo a livelier land; and so by tilth and grange,\\nAnd vines, and blowing bosks of wilderness,\\nWe gained the mother city thick with towers,\\nAnd in the imperial palace found the king.\\n\\nHis name was Gama; cracked and small his voice,\\nBut bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind\\nOn glassy water drove his cheek in lines;\\nA little dry old man, without a star,\\nNot like a king: three days he feasted us,\\nAnd on the fourth I spake of why we came,\\nAnd my bethrothed. \\'You do us, Prince,\\' he said,\\nAiring a snowy hand and signet gem,\\n\\'All honour. We remember love ourselves\\nIn our sweet youth: there did a compact pass\\nLong summers back, a kind of ceremony--\\nI think the year in which our olives failed.\\nI would you had her, Prince, with all my heart,\\nWith my full heart: but there were widows here,\\nTwo widows, Lady Psyche, Lady Blanche;\\nThey fed her theories, in and out of place\\nMaintaining that with equal husbandry\\nThe woman were an equal to the man.\\nThey harped on this; with this our banquets rang;\\nOur dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk;\\nNothing but this; my very ears were hot\\nTo hear them: knowledge, so my daughter held,\\nWas all in all: they had but been, she thought,\\nAs children; they must lose the child, assume\\nThe woman: then, Sir, awful odes she wrote,\\nToo awful, sure, for what they treated of,\\nBut all she is and does is awful; odes\\nAbout this losing of the child; and rhymes\\nAnd dismal lyrics, prophesying change\\nBeyond all reason: these the women sang;\\nAnd they that know such things--I sought but peace;\\nNo critic I--would call them masterpieces:\\nThey mastered ~me~. At last she begged a boon,\\nA certain summer-palace which I have\\nHard by your father\\'s frontier: I said no,\\nYet being an easy man, gave it: and there,\\nAll wild to found an University\\nFor maidens, on the spur she fled; and more\\nWe know not,--only this: they see no men,\\nNot even her brother Arac, nor the twins\\nHer brethren, though they love her, look upon her\\nAs on a kind of paragon; and I\\n(Pardon me saying it) were much loth to breed\\nDispute betwixt myself and mine: but since\\n(And I confess with right) you think me bound\\nIn some sort, I can give you letters to her;\\nAnd yet, to speak the truth, I rate your chance\\nAlmost at naked nothing.\\'\\nThus the king;\\nAnd I, though nettled that he seemed to slur\\nWith garrulous ease and oily courtesies\\nOur formal compact, yet, not less (all frets\\nBut chafing me on fire to find my bride)\\nWent forth again with both my friends. We rode\\nMany a long league back to the North. At last\\nFrom hills, that looked across a land of hope,\\nWe dropt with evening on a rustic town\\nSet in a gleaming river\\'s crescent-curve,\\nClose at the boundary of the liberties;\\nThere, entered an old hostel, called mine host\\nTo council, plied him with his richest wines,\\nAnd showed the late-writ letters of the king.\\n\\nHe with a long low sibilation, stared\\nAs blank as death in marble; then exclaimed\\nAverring it was clear against all rules\\nFor any man to go: but as his brain\\nBegan to mellow, \\'If the king,\\' he said,\\n\\'Had given us letters, was he bound to speak?\\nThe king would bear him out;\\' and at the last--\\nThe summer of the vine in all his veins--\\n\\'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.\\nShe once had past that way; he heard her speak;\\nShe scared him; life! he never saw the like;\\nShe looked as grand as doomsday and as grave:\\nAnd he, he reverenced his liege-lady there;\\nHe always made a point to post with mares;\\nHis daughter and his housemaid were the boys:\\nThe land, he understood, for miles about\\nWas tilled by women; all the swine were sows,\\nAnd all the dogs\\'--\\nBut while he jested thus,\\nA thought flashed through me which I clothed in act,\\nRemembering how we three presented Maid\\nOr Nymph, or Goddess, at high tide of feast,\\nIn masque or pageant at my father\\'s court.\\nWe sent mine host to purchase female gear;\\nHe brought it, and himself, a sight to shake\\nThe midriff of despair with laughter, holp\\nTo lace us up, till, each, in maiden plumes\\nWe rustled: him we gave a costly bribe\\nTo guerdon silence, mounted our good steeds,\\nAnd boldly ventured on the liberties.\\n\\nWe followed up the river as we rode,\\nAnd rode till midnight when the college lights\\nBegan to glitter firefly-like in copse\\nAnd linden alley: then we past an arch,\\nWhereon a woman-statue rose with wings\\nFrom four winged horses dark against the stars;\\nAnd some inscription ran along the front,\\nBut deep in shadow: further on we gained\\nA little street half garden and half house;\\nBut scarce could hear each other speak for noise\\nOf clocks and chimes, like silver hammers falling\\nOn silver anvils, and the splash and stir\\nOf fountains spouted up and showering down\\nIn meshes of the jasmine and the rose:\\nAnd all about us pealed the nightingale,\\nRapt in her song, and careless of the snare.\\n\\nThere stood a bust of Pallas for a sign,\\nBy two sphere lamps blazoned like Heaven and Earth\\nWith constellation and with continent,\\nAbove an entry: riding in, we called;\\nA plump-armed Ostleress and a stable wench\\nCame running at the call, and helped us down.\\nThen stept a buxom hostess forth, and sailed,\\nFull-blown, before us into rooms which gave\\nUpon a pillared porch, the bases lost\\nIn laurel: her we asked of that and this,\\nAnd who were tutors. \\'Lady Blanche\\' she said,\\n\\'And Lady Psyche.\\' \\'Which was prettiest,\\nBest-natured?\\' \\'Lady Psyche.\\' \\'Hers are we,\\'\\nOne voice, we cried; and I sat down and wrote,\\nIn such a hand as when a field of corn\\nBows all its ears before the roaring East;\\n\\n\\'Three ladies of the Northern empire pray\\nYour Highness would enroll them with your own,\\nAs Lady Psyche\\'s pupils.\\'\\nThis I sealed:\\nThe seal was Cupid bent above a scroll,\\nAnd o\\'er his head Uranian Venus hung,\\nAnd raised the blinding bandage from his eyes:\\nI gave the letter to be sent with dawn;\\nAnd then to bed, where half in doze I seemed\\nTo float about a glimmering night, and watch\\nA full sea glazed with muffled moonlight, swell\\nOn some dark shore just seen that it was rich.\\n\\nAs through the land at eve we went,\\nAnd plucked the ripened ears,\\nWe fell out, my wife and I,\\nO we fell out I know not why,\\nAnd kissed again with tears.\\nAnd blessings on the falling out\\nThat all the more endears,\\nWhen we fall out with those we love\\nAnd kiss again with tears!\\nFor when we came where lies the child\\nWe lost in other years,\\nThere above the little grave,\\nO there above the little grave,\\nWe kissed again with tears.\\n\\nII\\n\\nAt break of day the College Portress came:\\nShe brought us Academic silks, in hue\\nThe lilac, with a silken hood to each,\\nAnd zoned with gold; and now when these were on,\\nAnd we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,\\nShe, curtseying her obeisance, let us know\\nThe Princess Ida waited: out we paced,\\nI first, and following through the porch that sang\\nAll round with laurel, issued in a court\\nCompact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths\\nOf classic frieze, with ample awnings gay\\nBetwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.\\nThe Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,\\nEnringed a billowing fountain in the midst;\\nAnd here and there on lattice edges lay\\nOr book or lute; but hastily we past,\\nAnd up a flight of stairs into the hall.\\n\\nThere at a board by tome and paper sat,\\nWith two tame leopards couched beside her throne,\\nAll beauty compassed in a female form,\\nThe Princess; liker to the inhabitant\\nOf some clear planet close upon the Sun,\\nThan our man\\'s earth; such eyes were in her head,\\nAnd so much grace and power, breathing down\\nFrom over her arched brows, with every turn\\nLived through her to the tips of her long hands,\\nAnd to her feet. She rose her height, and said:\\n\\n\\'We give you welcome: not without redound\\nOf use and glory to yourselves ye come,\\nThe first-fruits of the stranger: aftertime,\\nAnd that full voice which circles round the grave,\\nWill rank you nobly, mingled up with me.\\nWhat! are the ladies of your land so tall?\\'\\n\\'We of the court\\' said Cyril. \\'From the court\\'\\nShe answered, \\'then ye know the Prince?\\' and he:\\n\\'The climax of his age! as though there were\\nOne rose in all the world, your Highness that,\\nHe worships your ideal:\\' she replied:\\n\\'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear\\nThis barren verbiage, current among men,\\nLight coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.\\nYour flight from out your bookless wilds would seem\\nAs arguing love of knowledge and of power;\\nYour language proves you still the child. Indeed,\\nWe dream not of him: when we set our hand\\nTo this great work, we purposed with ourself\\nNever to wed. You likewise will do well,\\nLadies, in entering here, to cast and fling\\nThe tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,\\nSome future time, if so indeed you will,\\nYou may with those self-styled our lords ally\\nYour fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.\\'\\n\\nAt those high words, we conscious of ourselves,\\nPerused the matting: then an officer\\nRose up, and read the statutes, such as these:\\nNot for three years to correspond with home;\\nNot for three years to cross the liberties;\\nNot for three years to speak with any men;\\nAnd many more, which hastily subscribed,\\nWe entered on the boards: and \\'Now,\\' she cried,\\n\\'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not. Look, our hall!\\nOur statues!--not of those that men desire,\\nSleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,\\nNor stunted squaws of West or East; but she\\nThat taught the Sabine how to rule, and she\\nThe foundress of the Babylonian wall,\\nThe Carian Artemisia strong in war,\\nThe Rhodope, that built the pyramid,\\nClelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene\\nThat fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows\\nOf Agrippina. Dwell with these, and lose\\nConvention, since to look on noble forms\\nMakes noble through the sensuous organism\\nThat which is higher. O lift your natures up:\\nEmbrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,\\nKnowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:\\nDrink deep, until the habits of the slave,\\nThe sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\\nAnd slander, die. Better not be at all\\nThan not be noble. Leave us: you may go:\\nToday the Lady Psyche will harangue\\nThe fresh arrivals of the week before;\\nFor they press in from all the provinces,\\nAnd fill the hive.\\'\\nShe spoke, and bowing waved\\nDismissal: back again we crost the court\\nTo Lady Psyche\\'s: as we entered in,\\nThere sat along the forms, like morning doves\\nThat sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,\\nA patient range of pupils; she herself\\nErect behind a desk of satin-wood,\\nA quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,\\nAnd on the hither side, or so she looked,\\nOf twenty summers. At her left, a child,\\nIn shining draperies, headed like a star,\\nHer maiden babe, a double April old,\\nAglaïa slept. We sat: the Lady glanced:\\nThen Florian, but not livelier than the dame\\nThat whispered \\'Asses\\' ears\\', among the sedge,\\n\\'My sister.\\' \\'Comely, too, by all that\\'s fair,\\'\\nSaid Cyril. \\'Oh hush, hush!\\' and she began.\\n\\n\\'This world was once a fluid haze of light,\\nTill toward the centre set the starry tides,\\nAnd eddied into suns, that wheeling cast\\nThe planets: then the monster, then the man;\\nTattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,\\nRaw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;\\nAs yet we find in barbarous isles, and here\\nAmong the lowest.\\'\\nThereupon she took\\nA bird\\'s-eye-view of all the ungracious past;\\nGlanced at the legendary Amazon\\nAs emblematic of a nobler age;\\nAppraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those\\nThat lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;\\nRan down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines\\nOf empire, and the woman\\'s state in each,\\nHow far from just; till warming with her theme\\nShe fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique\\nAnd little-footed China, touched on Mahomet\\nWith much contempt, and came to chivalry:\\nWhen some respect, however slight, was paid\\nTo woman, superstition all awry:\\nHowever then commenced the dawn: a beam\\nHad slanted forward, falling in a land\\nOf promise; fruit would follow. Deep, indeed,\\nTheir debt of thanks to her who first had dared\\nTo leap the rotten pales of prejudice,\\nDisyoke their necks from custom, and assert\\nNone lordlier than themselves but that which made\\nWoman and man. She had founded; they must build.\\nHere might they learn whatever men were taught:\\nLet them not fear: some said their heads were less:\\nSome men\\'s were small; not they the least of men;\\nFor often fineness compensated size:\\nBesides the brain was like the hand, and grew\\nWith using; thence the man\\'s, if more was more;\\nHe took advantage of his strength to be\\nFirst in the field: some ages had been lost;\\nBut woman ripened earlier, and her life\\nWas longer; and albeit their glorious names\\nWere fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth\\nThe highest is the measure of the man,\\nAnd not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,\\nNor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,\\nBut Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so\\nWith woman: and in arts of government\\nElizabeth and others; arts of war\\nThe peasant Joan and others; arts of grace\\nSappho and others vied with any man:\\nAnd, last not least, she who had left her place,\\nAnd bowed her state to them, that they might grow\\nTo use and power on this Oasis, lapt\\nIn the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight\\nOf ancient influence and scorn.\\nAt last\\nShe rose upon a wind of prophecy\\nDilating on the future; \\'everywhere\\nWho heads in council, two beside the hearth,\\nTwo in the tangled business of the world,\\nTwo in the liberal offices of life,\\nTwo plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss\\nOf science, and the secrets of the mind:\\nMusician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:\\nAnd everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth\\nShould bear a double growth of those rare souls,\\nPoets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.\\'\\n\\nShe ended here, and beckoned us: the rest\\nParted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she\\nBegan to address us, and was moving on\\nIn gratulation, till as when a boat\\nTacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice\\nFaltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried\\n\\'My brother!\\' \\'Well, my sister.\\' \\'O,\\' she said,\\n\\'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?\\nWhy who are these? a wolf within the fold!\\nA pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!\\nA plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!\\'\\n\\'No plot, no plot,\\' he answered. \\'Wretched boy,\\nHow saw you not the inscription on the gate,\\nLET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?\\'\\n\\'And if I had,\\' he answered, \\'who could think\\nThe softer Adams of your Academe,\\nO sister, Sirens though they be, were such\\nAs chanted on the blanching bones of men?\\'\\n\\'But you will find it otherwise\\' she said.\\n\\'You jest: ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow\\nBinds me to speak, and O that iron will,\\nThat axelike edge unturnable, our Head,\\nThe Princess.\\' \\'Well then, Psyche, take my life,\\nAnd nail me like a weasel on a grange\\nFor warning: bury me beside the gate,\\nAnd cut this epitaph above my bones;\\n~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,\\nAll for the common good of womankind.~\\'\\n\\'Let me die too,\\' said Cyril, \\'having seen\\nAnd heard the Lady Psyche.\\'\\nI struck in:\\n\\'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;\\nReceive it; and in me behold the Prince\\nYour countryman, affianced years ago\\nTo the Lady Ida: here, for here she was,\\nAnd thus (what other way was left) I came.\\'\\n\\'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;\\nIf any, this; but none. Whate\\'er I was\\nDisrooted, what I am is grafted here.\\nAffianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe\\nWithin this vestal limit, and how should I,\\nWho am not mine, say, live: the thunderbolt\\nHangs silent; but prepare: I speak; it falls.\\'\\n\\'Yet pause,\\' I said: \\'for that inscription there,\\nI think no more of deadly lurks therein,\\nThan in a clapper clapping in a garth,\\nTo scare the fowl from fruit: if more there be,\\nIf more and acted on, what follows? war;\\nYour own work marred: for this your Academe,\\nWhichever side be Victor, in the halloo\\nWill topple to the trumpet down, and pass\\nWith all fair theories only made to gild\\nA stormless summer.\\' \\'Let the Princess judge\\nOf that\\' she said: \\'farewell, Sir--and to you.\\nI shudder at the sequel, but I go.\\'\\n\\n\\'Are you that Lady Psyche,\\' I rejoined,\\n\\'The fifth in line from that old Florian,\\nYet hangs his portrait in my father\\'s hall\\n(The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow\\nSun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)\\nAs he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,\\nAnd all else fled? we point to it, and we say,\\nThe loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,\\nBut branches current yet in kindred veins.\\'\\n\\'Are you that Psyche,\\' Florian added; \\'she\\nWith whom I sang about the morning hills,\\nFlung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,\\nAnd snared the squirrel of the glen? are you\\nThat Psyche, won\\'t to bind my throbbing brow,\\nTo smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught\\nOf fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read\\nMy sickness down to happy dreams? are you\\nThat brother-sister Psyche, both in one?\\nYou were that Psyche, but what are you now?\\'\\n\\'You are that Psyche,\\' said Cyril, \\'for whom\\nI would be that for ever which I seem,\\nWoman, if I might sit beside your feet,\\nAnd glean your scattered sapience.\\'\\nThen once more,\\n\\'Are you that Lady Psyche,\\' I began,\\n\\'That on her bridal morn before she past\\nFrom all her old companions, when the kind\\nKissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties\\nWould still be dear beyond the southern hills;\\nThat were there any of our people there\\nIn want or peril, there was one to hear\\nAnd help them? look! for such are these and I.\\'\\n\\'Are you that Psyche,\\' Florian asked, \\'to whom,\\nIn gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn\\nCame flying while you sat beside the well?\\nThe creature laid his muzzle on your lap,\\nAnd sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood\\nWas sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.\\nThat was fawn\\'s blood, not brother\\'s, yet you wept.\\nO by the bright head of my little niece,\\nYou were that Psyche, and what are you now?\\'\\n\\'You are that Psyche,\\' Cyril said again,\\n\\'The mother of the sweetest little maid,\\nThat ever crowed for kisses.\\'\\n\\'Out upon it!\\'\\nShe answered, \\'peace! and why should I not play\\nThe Spartan Mother with emotion, be\\nThe Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?\\nHim you call great: he for the common weal,\\nThe fading politics of mortal Rome,\\nAs I might slay this child, if good need were,\\nSlew both his sons: and I, shall I, on whom\\nThe secular emancipation turns\\nOf half this world, be swerved from right to save\\nA prince, a brother? a little will I yield.\\nBest so, perchance, for us, and well for you.\\nO hard, when love and duty clash! I fear\\nMy conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--\\nHear my conditions: promise (otherwise\\nYou perish) as you came, to slip away\\nToday, tomorrow, soon: it shall be said,\\nThese women were too barbarous, would not learn;\\nThey fled, who might have shamed us: promise, all.\\'\\n\\nWhat could we else, we promised each; and she,\\nLike some wild creature newly-caged, commenced\\nA to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused\\nBy Florian; holding out her lily arms\\nTook both his hands, and smiling faintly said:\\n\\'I knew you at the first: though you have grown\\nYou scarce have altered: I am sad and glad\\nTo see you, Florian. ~I~ give thee to death\\nMy brother! it was duty spoke, not I.\\nMy needful seeming harshness, pardon it.\\nOur mother, is she well?\\'\\nWith that she kissed\\nHis forehead, then, a moment after, clung\\nAbout him, and betwixt them blossomed up\\nFrom out a common vein of memory\\nSweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,\\nAnd far allusion, till the gracious dews\\nBegan to glisten and to fall: and while\\nThey stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,\\n\\'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.\\'\\nBack started she, and turning round we saw\\nThe Lady Blanche\\'s daughter where she stood,\\nMelissa, with her hand upon the lock,\\nA rosy blonde, and in a college gown,\\nThat clad her like an April daffodilly\\n(Her mother\\'s colour) with her lips apart,\\nAnd all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,\\nAs bottom agates seen to wave and float\\nIn crystal currents of clear morning seas.\\n\\nSo stood that same fair creature at the door.\\nThen Lady Psyche, \\'Ah--Melissa--you!\\nYou heard us?\\' and Melissa, \\'O pardon me\\nI heard, I could not help it, did not wish:\\nBut, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,\\nNor think I bear that heart within my breast,\\nTo give three gallant gentlemen to death.\\'\\n\\'I trust you,\\' said the other, \\'for we two\\nWere always friends, none closer, elm and vine:\\nBut yet your mother\\'s jealous temperament--\\nLet not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove\\nThe Danaïd of a leaky vase, for fear\\nThis whole foundation ruin, and I lose\\nMy honour, these their lives.\\' \\'Ah, fear me not\\'\\nReplied Melissa; \\'no--I would not tell,\\nNo, not for all Aspasia\\'s cleverness,\\nNo, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things\\nThat Sheba came to ask of Solomon.\\'\\n\\'Be it so\\' the other, \\'that we still may lead\\nThe new light up, and culminate in peace,\\nFor Solomon may come to Sheba yet.\\'\\nSaid Cyril, \\'Madam, he the wisest man\\nFeasted the woman wisest then, in halls\\nOf Lebanonian cedar: nor should you\\n(Though, Madam, ~you~ should answer, ~we~ would ask)\\nLess welcome find among us, if you came\\nAmong us, debtors for our lives to you,\\nMyself for something more.\\' He said not what,\\nBut \\'Thanks,\\' she answered \\'Go: we have been too long\\nTogether: keep your hoods about the face;\\nThey do so that affect abstraction here.\\nSpeak little; mix not with the rest; and hold\\nYour promise: all, I trust, may yet be well.\\'\\n\\nWe turned to go, but Cyril took the child,\\nAnd held her round the knees against his waist,\\nAnd blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,\\nWhile Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child\\nPushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;\\nAnd thus our conference closed.\\nAnd then we strolled\\nFor half the day through stately theatres\\nBenched crescent-wise. In each we sat, we heard\\nThe grave Professor. On the lecture slate\\nThe circle rounded under female hands\\nWith flawless demonstration: followed then\\nA classic lecture, rich in sentiment,\\nWith scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out\\nBy violet-hooded Doctors, elegies\\nAnd quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long\\nThat on the stretched forefinger of all Time\\nSparkle for ever: then we dipt in all\\nThat treats of whatsoever is, the state,\\nThe total chronicles of man, the mind,\\nThe morals, something of the frame, the rock,\\nThe star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,\\nElectric, chemic laws, and all the rest,\\nAnd whatsoever can be taught and known;\\nTill like three horses that have broken fence,\\nAnd glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,\\nWe issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:\\n\\'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.\\'\\n\\'They hunt old trails\\' said Cyril \\'very well;\\nBut when did woman ever yet invent?\\'\\n\\'Ungracious!\\' answered Florian; \\'have you learnt\\nNo more from Psyche\\'s lecture, you that talked\\nThe trash that made me sick, and almost sad?\\'\\n\\'O trash\\' he said, \\'but with a kernel in it.\\nShould I not call her wise, who made me wise?\\nAnd learnt? I learnt more from her in a flash,\\nThan in my brainpan were an empty hull,\\nAnd every Muse tumbled a science in.\\nA thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,\\nAnd round these halls a thousand baby loves\\nFly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,\\nWhence follows many a vacant pang; but O\\nWith me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,\\nThe Head of all the golden-shafted firm,\\nThe long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;\\nHe cleft me through the stomacher; and now\\nWhat think you of it, Florian? do I chase\\nThe substance or the shadow? will it hold?\\nI have no sorcerer\\'s malison on me,\\nNo ghostly hauntings like his Highness. I\\nFlatter myself that always everywhere\\nI know the substance when I see it. Well,\\nAre castles shadows? Three of them? Is she\\nThe sweet proprietress a shadow?

Hither came\\nCyril, and yawning \\'O hard task,\\' he cried;\\n\\'No fighting shadows here! I forced a way\\nThrough opposition crabbed and gnarled.\\nBetter to clear prime forests, heave and thump\\nA league of street in summer solstice down,\\nThan hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.\\nI knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there\\nAt point to move, and settled in her eyes\\nThe green malignant light of coming storm.\\nSir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,\\nAs man\\'s could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed\\nConcealment: she demanded who we were,\\nAnd why we came? I fabled nothing fair,\\nBut, your example pilot, told her all.\\nUp went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.\\nBut when I dwelt upon your old affiance,\\nShe answered sharply that I talked astray.\\nI urged the fierce inscription on the gate,\\nAnd our three lives. True--we had limed ourselves\\nWith open eyes, and we must take the chance.\\nBut such extremes, I told her, well might harm\\nThe woman\\'s cause. \"Not more than now,\" she said,\\n\"So puddled as it is with favouritism.\"\\nI tried the mother\\'s heart. Shame might befall\\nMelissa, knowing, saying not she knew:\\nHer answer was \"Leave me to deal with that.\"\\nI spoke of war to come and many deaths,\\nAnd she replied, her duty was to speak,\\nAnd duty duty, clear of consequences.\\nI grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years,\\nI recommenced; \"Decide not ere you pause.\\nI find you here but in the second place,\\nSome say the third--the authentic foundress you.\\nI offer boldly: we will seat you highest:\\nWink at our advent: help my prince to gain\\nHis rightful bride, and here I promise you\\nSome palace in our land, where you shall reign\\nThe head and heart of all our fair she-world,\\nAnd your great name flow on with broadening time\\nFor ever.\" Well, she balanced this a little,\\nAnd told me she would answer us today,\\nmeantime be mute: thus much, nor more I gained.\\'\\n\\nHe ceasing, came a message from the Head.\\n\\'That afternoon the Princess rode to take\\nThe dip of certain strata to the North.\\nWould we go with her? we should find the land\\nWorth seeing; and the river made a fall\\nOut yonder:\\' then she pointed on to where\\nA double hill ran up his furrowy forks\\nBeyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.\\n\\nAgreed to, this, the day fled on through all\\nIts range of duties to the appointed hour.\\nThen summoned to the porch we went. She stood\\nAmong her maidens, higher by the head,\\nHer back against a pillar, her foot on one\\nOf those tame leopards. Kittenlike he rolled\\nAnd pawed about her sandal. I drew near;\\nI gazed. On a sudden my strange seizure came\\nUpon me, the weird vision of our house:\\nThe Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,\\nHer gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,\\nHer college and her maidens, empty masks,\\nAnd I myself the shadow of a dream,\\nFor all things were and were not. Yet I felt\\nMy heart beat thick with passion and with awe;\\nThen from my breast the involuntary sigh\\nBrake, as she smote me with the light of eyes\\nThat lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook\\nMy pulses, till to horse we got, and so\\nWent forth in long retinue following up\\nThe river as it narrowed to the hills.\\n\\nI rode beside her and to me she said:\\n\\'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not\\nToo harsh to your companion yestermorn;\\nUnwillingly we spake.\\' \\'No--not to her,\\'\\nI answered, \\'but to one of whom we spake\\nYour Highness might have seemed the thing you say.\\'\\n\\'Again?\\' she cried, \\'are you ambassadresses\\nFrom him to me? we give you, being strange,\\nA license: speak, and let the topic die.\\'\\n\\nI stammered that I knew him--could have wished--\\n\\'Our king expects--was there no precontract?\\nThere is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem\\nAll he prefigured, and he could not see\\nThe bird of passage flying south but longed\\nTo follow: surely, if your Highness keep\\nYour purport, you will shock him even to death,\\nOr baser courses, children of despair.\\'\\n\\n\\'Poor boy,\\' she said, \\'can he not read--no books?\\nQuoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that\\nWhich men delight in, martial exercise?\\nTo nurse a blind ideal like a girl,\\nMethinks he seems no better than a girl;\\nAs girls were once, as we ourself have been:\\nWe had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:\\nWe touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,\\nBeing other--since we learnt our meaning here,\\nTo lift the woman\\'s fallen divinity\\nUpon an even pedestal with man.\\'\\n\\nShe paused, and added with a haughtier smile\\n\\'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,\\nAt no man\\'s beck, but know ourself and thee,\\nO Vashti, noble Vashti! Summoned out\\nShe kept her state, and left the drunken king\\nTo brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.\\'\\n\\n\\'Alas your Highness breathes full East,\\' I said,\\n\\'On that which leans to you. I know the Prince,\\nI prize his truth: and then how vast a work\\nTo assail this gray preëminence of man!\\nYou grant me license; might I use it? think;\\nEre half be done perchance your life may fail;\\nThen comes the feebler heiress of your plan,\\nAnd takes and ruins all; and thus your pains\\nMay only make that footprint upon sand\\nWhich old-recurring waves of prejudice\\nResmooth to nothing: might I dread that you,\\nWith only Fame for spouse and your great deeds\\nFor issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,\\nMeanwhile, what every woman counts her due,\\nLove, children, happiness?\\'\\nAnd she exclaimed,\\n\\'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!\\nWhat! though your Prince\\'s love were like a God\\'s,\\nHave we not made ourself the sacrifice?\\nYou are bold indeed: we are not talked to thus:\\nYet will we say for children, would they grew\\nLike field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:\\nBut children die; and let me tell you, girl,\\nHowe\\'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;\\nThey with the sun and moon renew their light\\nFor ever, blessing those that look on them.\\nChildren--that men may pluck them from our hearts,\\nKill us with pity, break us with ourselves--\\nO--children--there is nothing upon earth\\nMore miserable than she that has a son\\nAnd sees him err: nor would we work for fame;\\nThough she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,\\nWho earns the one POU STO whence after-hands\\nMay move the world, though she herself effect\\nBut little: wherefore up and act, nor shrink\\nFor fear our solid aim be dissipated\\nBy frail successors. Would, indeed, we had been,\\nIn lieu of many mortal flies, a race\\nOf giants living, each, a thousand years,\\nThat we might see our own work out, and watch\\nThe sandy footprint harden into stone.\\'\\n\\nI answered nothing, doubtful in myself\\nIf that strange Poet-princess with her grand\\nImaginations might at all be won.\\nAnd she broke out interpreting my thoughts:\\n\\n\\'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;\\nWe are used to that: for women, up till this\\nCramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,\\nDwarfs of the gynæceum, fail so far\\nIn high desire, they know not, cannot guess\\nHow much their welfare is a passion to us.\\nIf we could give them surer, quicker proof--\\nOh if our end were less achievable\\nBy slow approaches, than by single act\\nOf immolation, any phase of death,\\nWe were as prompt to spring against the pikes,\\nOr down the fiery gulf as talk of it,\\nTo compass our dear sisters\\' liberties.\\'\\n\\nShe bowed as if to veil a noble tear;\\nAnd up we came to where the river sloped\\nTo plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks\\nA breadth of thunder. O\\'er it shook the woods,\\nAnd danced the colour, and, below, stuck out\\nThe bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared\\nBefore man was. She gazed awhile and said,\\n\\'As these rude bones to us, are we to her\\nThat will be.\\' \\'Dare we dream of that,\\' I asked,\\n\\'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,\\nThat practice betters?\\' \\'How,\\' she cried, \\'you love\\nThe metaphysics! read and earn our prize,\\nA golden brooch: beneath an emerald plane\\nSits Diotima, teaching him that died\\nOf hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;\\nShe rapt upon her subject, he on her:\\nFor there are schools for all.\\' \\'And yet\\' I said\\n\\'Methinks I have not found among them all\\nOne anatomic.\\' \\'Nay, we thought of that,\\'\\nShe answered, \\'but it pleased us not: in truth\\nWe shudder but to dream our maids should ape\\nThose monstrous males that carve the living hound,\\nAnd cram him with the fragments of the grave,\\nOr in the dark dissolving human heart,\\nAnd holy secrets of this microcosm,\\nDabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,\\nEncarnalize their spirits: yet we know\\nKnowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:\\nHowbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,\\nNor willing men should come among us, learnt,\\nFor many weary moons before we came,\\nThis craft of healing. Were you sick, ourself\\nWould tend upon you. To your question now,\\nWhich touches on the workman and his work.\\nLet there be light and there was light: \\'tis so:\\nFor was, and is, and will be, are but is;\\nAnd all creation is one act at once,\\nThe birth of light: but we that are not all,\\nAs parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,\\nAnd live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make\\nOne act a phantom of succession: thus\\nOur weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;\\nBut in the shadow will we work, and mould\\nThe woman to the fuller day.\\'\\nShe spake\\nWith kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,\\nAnd, o\\'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came\\nOn flowery levels underneath the crag,\\nFull of all beauty. \\'O how sweet\\' I said\\n(For I was half-oblivious of my mask)\\n\\'To linger here with one that loved us.\\' \\'Yea,\\'\\nShe answered, \\'or with fair philosophies\\nThat lift the fancy; for indeed these fields\\nAre lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,\\nWhere paced the Demigods of old, and saw\\nThe soft white vapour streak the crownèd towers\\nBuilt to the Sun:\\' then, turning to her maids,\\n\\'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;\\nLay out the viands.\\' At the word, they raised\\nA tent of satin, elaborately wrought\\nWith fair Corinna\\'s triumph; here she stood,\\nEngirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,\\nThe woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there\\nThe bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,\\nAnd all the men mourned at his side: but we\\nSet forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept\\nWith Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I\\nWith mine affianced. Many a little hand\\nGlanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,\\nMany a light foot shone like a jewel set\\nIn the dark crag: and then we turned, we wound\\nAbout the cliffs, the copses, out and in,\\nHammering and clinking, chattering stony names\\nOf shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,\\nAmygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun\\nGrew broader toward his death and fell, and all\\nThe rosy heights came out above the lawns.\\n\\nThe splendour falls on castle walls\\nAnd snowy summits old in story:\\nThe long light shakes across the lakes,\\nAnd the wild cataract leaps in glory.\\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\\n\\nO hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\\nAnd thinner, clearer, farther going!\\nO sweet and far from cliff and scar\\nThe horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\\n\\nO love, they die in yon rich sky,\\nThey faint on hill or field or river:\\nOur echoes roll from soul to soul,\\nAnd grow for ever and for ever.\\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,\\nIf that hypothesis of theirs be sound\\'\\nSaid Ida; \\'let us down and rest;\\' and we\\nDown from the lean and wrinkled precipices,\\nBy every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,\\nDropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below\\nNo bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent\\nLamp-lit from the inner. Once she leaned on me,\\nDescending; once or twice she lent her hand,\\nAnd blissful palpitations in the blood,\\nStirring a sudden transport rose and fell.\\n\\nBut when we planted level feet, and dipt\\nBeneath the satin dome and entered in,\\nThere leaning deep in broidered down we sank\\nOur elbows: on a tripod in the midst\\nA fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed\\nFruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.\\n\\nThen she, \\'Let some one sing to us: lightlier move\\nThe minutes fledged with music:\\' and a maid,\\nOf those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.\\n\\n\\'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\\nIn looking on the happy Autumn-fields,\\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\\n\\n\\'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\\nSad as the last which reddens over one\\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\\n\\n\\'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\\n\\n\\'Dear as remembered kisses after death,\\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\\'\\n\\nShe ended with such passion that the tear,\\nShe sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl\\nLost in her bosom: but with some disdain\\nAnswered the Princess, \\'If indeed there haunt\\nAbout the mouldered lodges of the Past\\nSo sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,\\nWell needs it we should cram our ears with wool\\nAnd so pace by: but thine are fancies hatched\\nIn silken-folded idleness; nor is it\\nWiser to weep a true occasion lost,\\nBut trim our sails, and let old bygones be,\\nWhile down the streams that float us each and all\\nTo the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,\\nThrone after throne, and molten on the waste\\nBecomes a cloud: for all things serve their time\\nToward that great year of equal mights and rights,\\nNor would I fight with iron laws, in the end\\nFound golden: let the past be past; let be\\nTheir cancelled Babels: though the rough kex break\\nThe starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat\\nHang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split\\nTheir monstrous idols, care not while we hear\\nA trumpet in the distance pealing news\\nOf better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns\\nAbove the unrisen morrow:\\' then to me;\\n\\'Know you no song of your own land,\\' she said,\\n\\'Not such as moans about the retrospect,\\nBut deals with the other distance and the hues\\nOf promise; not a death\\'s-head at the wine.\\'\\n\\nThen I remembered one myself had made,\\nWhat time I watched the swallow winging south\\nFrom mine own land, part made long since, and part\\nNow while I sang, and maidenlike as far\\nAs I could ape their treble, did I sing.\\n\\n\\'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,\\nFly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,\\nAnd tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.\\n\\n\\'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,\\nThat bright and fierce and fickle is the South,\\nAnd dark and true and tender is the North.\\n\\n\\'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light\\nUpon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,\\nAnd cheep and twitter twenty million loves.\\n\\n\\'O were I thou that she might take me in,\\nAnd lay me on her bosom, and her heart\\nWould rock the snowy cradle till I died.\\n\\n\\'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\\nDelaying as the tender ash delays\\nTo clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\\n\\n\\'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:\\nSay to her, I do but wanton in the South,\\nBut in the North long since my nest is made.\\n\\n\\'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,\\nAnd brief the sun of summer in the North,\\nAnd brief the moon of beauty in the South.\\n\\n\\'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,\\nFly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,\\nAnd tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.\\'\\n\\nI ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,\\nLike the Ithacensian suitors in old time,\\nStared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,\\nAnd knew not what they meant; for still my voice\\nRang false: but smiling \\'Not for thee,\\' she said,\\nO Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan\\nShall burst her veil: marsh-divers, rather, maid,\\nShall croak thee sister, or the meadow-crake\\nGrate her harsh kindred in the grass: and this\\nA mere love-poem! O for such, my friend,\\nWe hold them slight: they mind us of the time\\nWhen we made bricks in Egypt. Knaves are men,\\nThat lute and flute fantastic tenderness,\\nAnd dress the victim to the offering up,\\nAnd paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,\\nAnd play the slave to gain the tyranny.\\nPoor soul! I had a maid of honour once;\\nShe wept her true eyes blind for such a one,\\nA rogue of canzonets and serenades.\\nI loved her. Peace be with her. She is dead.\\nSo they blaspheme the muse! But great is song\\nUsed to great ends: ourself have often tried\\nValkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed\\nThe passion of the prophetess; for song\\nIs duer unto freedom, force and growth\\nOf spirit than to junketing and love.\\nLove is it? Would this same mock-love, and this\\nMock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,\\nTill all men grew to rate us at our worth,\\nNot vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes\\nTo be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered\\nWhole in ourselves and owed to none. Enough!\\nBut now to leaven play with profit, you,\\nKnow you no song, the true growth of your soil,\\nThat gives the manners of your country-women?\\'\\n\\nShe spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes\\nOf shining expectation fixt on mine.\\nThen while I dragged my brains for such a song,\\nCyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,\\nOr mastered by the sense of sport, began\\nTo troll a careless, careless tavern-catch\\nOf Moll and Meg, and strange experiences\\nUnmeet for ladies. Florian nodded at him,\\nI frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;\\nThe lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;\\n\\'Forbear,\\' the Princess cried; \\'Forbear, Sir\\' I;\\nAnd heated through and through with wrath and love,\\nI smote him on the breast; he started up;\\nThere rose a shriek as of a city sacked;\\nMelissa clamoured \\'Flee the death;\\' \\'To horse\\'\\nSaid Ida; \\'home! to horse!\\' and fled, as flies\\nA troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,\\nWhen some one batters at the dovecote-doors,\\nDisorderly the women. Alone I stood\\nWith Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,\\nIn the pavilion: there like parting hopes\\nI heard them passing from me: hoof by hoof,\\nAnd every hoof a knell to my desires,\\nClanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,\\n\\'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!\\'\\nFor blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled\\nIn the river. Out I sprang from glow to gloom:\\nThere whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch\\nRapt to the horrible fall: a glance I gave,\\nNo more; but woman-vested as I was\\nPlunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then\\nOaring one arm, and bearing in my left\\nThe weight of all the hopes of half the world,\\nStrove to buffet to land in vain. A tree\\nWas half-disrooted from his place and stooped\\nTo wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave\\nMid-channel. Right on this we drove and caught,\\nAnd grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.\\n\\nThere stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped\\nIn the hollow bank. One reaching forward drew\\nMy burthen from mine arms; they cried \\'she lives:\\'\\nThey bore her back into the tent: but I,\\nSo much a kind of shame within me wrought,\\nNot yet endured to meet her opening eyes,\\nNor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot\\n(For since her horse was lost I left her mine)\\nAcross the woods, and less from Indian craft\\nThan beelike instinct hiveward, found at length\\nThe garden portals. Two great statues, Art\\nAnd Science, Caryatids, lifted up\\nA weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves\\nOf open-work in which the hunter rued\\nHis rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows\\nHad sprouted, and the branches thereupon\\nSpread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.\\n\\nA little space was left between the horns,\\nThrough which I clambered o\\'er at top with pain,\\nDropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,\\nAnd, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,\\nNow poring on the glowworm, now the star,\\nI paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled\\nThrough a great arc his seven slow suns.\\nA step\\nOf lightest echo, then a loftier form\\nThan female, moving through the uncertain gloom,\\nDisturbed me with the doubt \\'if this were she,\\'\\nBut it was Florian. \\'Hist O Hist,\\' he said,\\n\\'They seek us: out so late is out of rules.\\nMoreover \"seize the strangers\" is the cry.\\nHow came you here?\\' I told him: \\'I\\' said he,\\n\\'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,\\nTo whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.\\nArriving all confused among the rest\\nWith hooded brows I crept into the hall,\\nAnd, couched behind a Judith, underneath\\nThe head of Holofernes peeped and saw.\\nGirl after girl was called to trial: each\\nDisclaimed all knowledge of us: last of all,\\nMelissa: trust me, Sir, I pitied her.\\nShe, questioned if she knew us men, at first\\nWas silent; closer prest, denied it not:\\nAnd then, demanded if her mother knew,\\nOr Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:\\nFrom whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,\\nEasily gathered either guilt. She sent\\nFor Psyche, but she was not there; she called\\nFor Psyche\\'s child to cast it from the doors;\\nShe sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;\\nAnd I slipt out: but whither will you now?\\nAnd where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:\\nWhat, if together? that were not so well.\\nWould rather we had never come!

Fear\\nStared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged\\nHer transit to the throne, whereby she fell\\nDelivering sealed dispatches which the Head\\nTook half-amazed, and in her lion\\'s mood\\nTore open, silent we with blind surmise\\nRegarding, while she read, till over brow\\nAnd cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom\\nAs of some fire against a stormy cloud,\\nWhen the wild peasant rights himself, the rick\\nFlames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;\\nFor anger most it seemed, while now her breast,\\nBeaten with some great passion at her heart,\\nPalpitated, her hand shook, and we heard\\nIn the dead hush the papers that she held\\nRustle: at once the lost lamb at her feet\\nSent out a bitter bleating for its dam;\\nThe plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed\\nThe scrolls together, made a sudden turn\\nAs if to speak, but, utterance failing her,\\nShe whirled them on to me, as who should say\\n\\'Read,\\' and I read--two letters--one her sire\\'s.\\n\\n\\'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,\\nWe knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,\\nWe, conscious of what temper you are built,\\nCame all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell\\nInto his father\\'s hands, who has this night,\\nYou lying close upon his territory,\\nSlipt round and in the dark invested you,\\nAnd here he keeps me hostage for his son.\\'\\n\\nThe second was my father\\'s running thus:\\n\\'You have our son: touch not a hair of his head:\\nRender him up unscathed: give him your hand:\\nCleave to your contract: though indeed we hear\\nYou hold the woman is the better man;\\nA rampant heresy, such as if it spread\\nWould make all women kick against their Lords\\nThrough all the world, and which might well deserve\\nThat we this night should pluck your palace down;\\nAnd we will do it, unless you send us back\\nOur son, on the instant, whole.\\'\\nSo far I read;\\nAnd then stood up and spoke impetuously.\\n\\n\\'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,\\nBut led by golden wishes, and a hope\\nThe child of regal compact, did I break\\nYour precinct; not a scorner of your sex\\nBut venerator, zealous it should be\\nAll that it might be: hear me, for I bear,\\nThough man, yet human, whatsoe\\'er your wrongs,\\nFrom the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life\\nLess mine than yours: my nurse would tell me of you;\\nI babbled for you, as babies for the moon,\\nVague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me\\nFrom all high places, lived in all fair lights,\\nCame in long breezes rapt from inmost south\\nAnd blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn\\nWith Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;\\nThe leader wildswan in among the stars\\nWould clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light\\nThe mellow breaker murmured Ida.

She stretched her arms and called\\nAcross the tumult and the tumult fell.\\n\\n\\'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?\\nOn me, me, me, the storm first breaks: ~I~ dare\\nAll these male thunderbolts: what is it ye fear?\\nPeace! there are those to avenge us and they come:\\nIf not,--myself were like enough, O girls,\\nTo unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,\\nAnd clad in iron burst the ranks of war,\\nOr, falling, promartyr of our cause,\\nDie: yet I blame you not so much for fear:\\nSix thousand years of fear have made you that\\nFrom which I would redeem you: but for those\\nThat stir this hubbub--you and you--I know\\nYour faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn\\nWe hold a great convention: then shall they\\nThat love their voices more than duty, learn\\nWith whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live\\nNo wiser than their mothers, household stuff,\\nLive chattels, mincers of each other\\'s fame,\\nFull of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,\\nThe drunkard\\'s football, laughing-stocks of Time,\\nWhose brains are in their hands and in their heels\\nBut fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,\\nTo tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,\\nFor ever slaves at home and fools abroad.\\'\\n\\nShe, ending, waved her hands: thereat the crowd\\nMuttering, dissolved: then with a smile, that looked\\nA stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,\\nWhen all the glens are drowned in azure gloom\\nOf thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:\\n\\n\\'You have done well and like a gentleman,\\nAnd like a prince: you have our thanks for all:\\nAnd you look well too in your woman\\'s dress:\\nWell have you done and like a gentleman.\\nYou saved our life: we owe you bitter thanks:\\nBetter have died and spilt our bones in the flood--\\nThen men had said--but now--What hinders me\\nTo take such bloody vengeance on you both?--\\nYet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,\\nYou would-be quenchers of the light to be,\\nBarbarians, grosser than your native bears--\\nO would I had his sceptre for one hour!\\nYou that have dared to break our bound, and gulled\\nOur servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--\\n~I~ wed with thee! ~I~ bound by precontract\\nYour bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold\\nThat veins the world were packed to make your crown,\\nAnd every spoken tongue should lord you.

While I listened, came\\nOn a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:\\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts;\\nThe Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,\\nThe jest and earnest working side by side,\\nThe cataract and the tumult and the kings\\nWere shadows; and the long fantastic night\\nWith all its doings had and had not been,\\nAnd all things were and were not.\\nThis went by\\nAs strangely as it came, and on my spirits\\nSettled a gentle cloud of melancholy;\\nNot long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts\\nAnd sudden ghostly shadowings I was one\\nTo whom the touch of all mischance but came\\nAs night to him that sitting on a hill\\nSees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun\\nSet into sunrise; then we moved away.\\n\\nThy voice is heard through rolling drums,\\nThat beat to battle where he stands;\\nThy face across his fancy comes,\\nAnd gives the battle to his hands:\\nA moment, while the trumpets blow,\\nHe sees his brood about thy knee;\\nThe next, like fire he meets the foe,\\nAnd strikes him dead for thine and thee.\\n\\nSo Lilia sang: we thought her half-possessed,\\nShe struck such warbling fury through the words;\\nAnd, after, feigning pique at what she called\\nThe raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--\\nLike one that wishes at a dance to change\\nThe music--clapt her hands and cried for war,\\nOr some grand fight to kill and make an end:\\nAnd he that next inherited the tale\\nHalf turning to the broken statue, said,\\n\\'Sir Ralph has got your colours: if I prove\\nYour knight, and fight your battle, what for me?\\'\\nIt chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb\\nLay by her like a model of her hand.\\nShe took it and she flung it. \\'Fight\\' she said,\\n\\'And make us all we would be, great and good.\\'\\nHe knightlike in his cap instead of casque,\\nA cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,\\nArranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.\\n\\nV\\n\\nNow, scarce three paces measured from the mound,\\nWe stumbled on a stationary voice,\\nAnd \\'Stand, who goes?\\' \\'Two from the palace\\' I.\\n\\'The second two: they wait,\\' he said, \\'pass on;\\nHis Highness wakes:\\' and one, that clashed in arms,\\nBy glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led\\nThreading the soldier-city, till we heard\\nThe drowsy folds of our great ensign shake\\nFrom blazoned lions o\\'er the imperial tent\\nWhispers of war.\\nEntering, the sudden light\\nDazed me half-blind: I stood and seemed to hear,\\nAs in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes\\nA lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,\\nEach hissing in his neighbour\\'s ear; and then\\nA strangled titter, out of which there brake\\nOn all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,\\nUnmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings\\nBegan to wag their baldness up and down,\\nThe fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,\\nThe huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,\\nAnd slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.\\n\\nAt length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,\\nPanted from weary sides \\'King, you are free!\\nWe did but keep you surety for our son,\\nIf this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,\\nThat tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:\\'\\nFor I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,\\nMore crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,\\nAnd all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.\\nThen some one sent beneath his vaulted palm\\nA whispered jest to some one near him, \\'Look,\\nHe has been among his shadows.\\' \\'Satan take\\nThe old women and their shadows! (thus the King\\nRoared) make yourself a man to fight with men.\\nGo: Cyril told us all.\\'\\nAs boys that slink\\nFrom ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,\\nAway we stole, and transient in a trice\\nFrom what was left of faded woman-slough\\nTo sheathing splendours and the golden scale\\nOf harness, issued in the sun, that now\\nLeapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,\\nAnd hit the Northern hills. Here Cyril met us.\\nA little shy at first, but by and by\\nWe twain, with mutual pardon asked and given\\nFor stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon\\nFollowed his tale. Amazed he fled away\\nThrough the dark land, and later in the night\\nHad come on Psyche weeping: \\'then we fell\\nInto your father\\'s hand, and there she lies,\\nBut will not speak, or stir.\\'\\nHe showed a tent\\nA stone-shot off: we entered in, and there\\nAmong piled arms and rough accoutrements,\\nPitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier\\'s cloak,\\nLike some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,\\nAnd pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,\\nAll her fair length upon the ground she lay:\\nAnd at her head a follower of the camp,\\nA charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,\\nSat watching like the watcher by the dead.\\n\\nThen Florian knelt, and \\'Come\\' he whispered to her,\\n\\'Lift up your head, sweet sister: lie not thus.\\nWhat have you done but right? you could not slay\\nMe, nor your prince: look up: be comforted:\\nSweet is it to have done the thing one ought,\\nWhen fallen in darker ways.\\' And likewise I:\\n\\'Be comforted: have I not lost her too,\\nIn whose least act abides the nameless charm\\nThat none has else for me?\\' She heard, she moved,\\nShe moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,\\nAnd raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth\\nAs those that mourn half-shrouded over death\\nIn deathless marble. \\'Her,\\' she said, \\'my friend--\\nParted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--\\nWhere shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?\\nO base and bad! what comfort? none for me!\\'\\nTo whom remorseful Cyril, \\'Yet I pray\\nTake comfort: live, dear lady, for your child!\\'\\nAt which she lifted up her voice and cried.\\n\\n\\'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,\\nMy one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!\\nFor now will cruel Ida keep her back;\\nAnd either she will die from want of care,\\nOr sicken with ill-usage, when they say\\nThe child is hers--for every little fault,\\nThe child is hers; and they will beat my girl\\nRemembering her mother: O my flower!\\nOr they will take her, they will make her hard,\\nAnd she will pass me by in after-life\\nWith some cold reverence worse than were she dead.\\nIll mother that I was to leave her there,\\nTo lag behind, scared by the cry they made,\\nThe horror of the shame among them all:\\nBut I will go and sit beside the doors,\\nAnd make a wild petition night and day,\\nUntil they hate to hear me like a wind\\nWailing for ever, till they open to me,\\nAnd lay my little blossom at my feet,\\nMy babe, my sweet Aglaïa, my one child:\\nAnd I will take her up and go my way,\\nAnd satisfy my soul with kissing her:\\nAh! what might that man not deserve of me\\nWho gave me back my child?\\' \\'Be comforted,\\'\\nSaid Cyril, \\'you shall have it:\\' but again\\nShe veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so\\nLike tender things that being caught feign death,\\nSpoke not, nor stirred.\\nBy this a murmur ran\\nThrough all the camp and inward raced the scouts\\nWith rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.\\nWe left her by the woman, and without\\nFound the gray kings at parle: and \\'Look you\\' cried\\nMy father \\'that our compact be fulfilled:\\nYou have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:\\nShe wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:\\nBut red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;\\nShe yields, or war.\\'\\nThen Gama turned to me:\\n\\'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time\\nWith our strange girl: and yet they say that still\\nYou love her. Give us, then, your mind at large:\\nHow say you, war or not?\\'\\n\\'Not war, if possible,\\nO king,\\' I said, \\'lest from the abuse of war,\\nThe desecrated shrine, the trampled year,\\nThe smouldering homestead, and the household flower\\nTorn from the lintel--all the common wrong--\\nA smoke go up through which I loom to her\\nThree times a monster: now she lightens scorn\\nAt him that mars her plan, but then would hate\\n(And every voice she talked with ratify it,\\nAnd every face she looked on justify it)\\nThe general foe. More soluble is this knot,\\nBy gentleness than war. I want her love.\\nWhat were I nigher this although we dashed\\nYour cities into shards with catapults,\\nShe would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,\\nThe lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,\\nNot ever would she love; but brooding turn\\nThe book of scorn, till all my flitting chance\\nWere caught within the record of her wrongs,\\nAnd crushed to death: and rather, Sire, than this\\nI would the old God of war himself were dead,\\nForgotten, rusting on his iron hills,\\nRotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,\\nOr like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,\\nNot to be molten out.\\'\\nAnd roughly spake\\nMy father, \\'Tut, you know them not, the girls.\\nBoy, when I hear you prate I almost think\\nThat idiot legend credible.

I kissed it and I read.\\n\\n\\'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,\\nWhat heats of indignation when we heard\\nOf those that iron-cramped their women\\'s feet;\\nOf lands in which at the altar the poor bride\\nGives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;\\nOf living hearts that crack within the fire\\nWhere smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--\\nMothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling\\nTheir pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops\\nThe vulture, beak and talon, at the heart\\nMade for all noble motion: and I saw\\nThat equal baseness lived in sleeker times\\nWith smoother men: the old leaven leavened all:\\nMillions of throats would bawl for civil rights,\\nNo woman named: therefore I set my face\\nAgainst all men, and lived but for mine own.\\nFar off from men I built a fold for them:\\nI stored it full of rich memorial:\\nI fenced it round with gallant institutes,\\nAnd biting laws to scare the beasts of prey\\nAnd prospered; till a rout of saucy boys\\nBrake on us at our books, and marred our peace,\\nMasked like our maids, blustering I know not what\\nOf insolence and love, some pretext held\\nOf baby troth, invalid, since my will\\nSealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--\\nI tamed my leopards: shall I not tame these?\\nOr you? or I? for since you think me touched\\nIn honour--what, I would not aught of false--\\nIs not our case pure? and whereas I know\\nYour prowess, Arac, and what mother\\'s blood\\nYou draw from, fight; you failing, I abide\\nWhat end soever: fail you will not. Still\\nTake not his life: he risked it for my own;\\nHis mother lives: yet whatsoe\\'er you do,\\nFight and fight well; strike and strike him. O dear\\nBrothers, the woman\\'s Angel guards you, you\\nThe sole men to be mingled with our cause,\\nThe sole men we shall prize in the after-time,\\nYour very armour hallowed, and your statues\\nReared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,\\nWe plant a solid foot into the Time,\\nAnd mould a generation strong to move\\nWith claim on claim from right to right, till she\\nWhose name is yoked with children\\'s, know herself;\\nAnd Knowledge in our own land make her free,\\nAnd, ever following those two crownèd twins,\\nCommerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain\\nOf freedom broadcast over all the orbs\\nBetween the Northern and the Southern morn.\\'\\n\\nThen came a postscript dashed across the rest.\\nSee that there be no traitors in your camp:\\nWe seem a nest of traitors--none to trust\\nSince our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!\\nAlmost our maids were better at their homes,\\nThan thus man-girdled here: indeed I think\\nOur chiefest comfort is the little child\\nOf one unworthy mother; which she left:\\nShe shall not have it back: the child shall grow\\nTo prize the authentic mother of her mind.\\nI took it for an hour in mine own bed\\nThis morning: there the tender orphan hands\\nFelt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence\\nThe wrath I nursed against the world: farewell.\\'\\n\\nI ceased; he said, \\'Stubborn, but she may sit\\nUpon a king\\'s right hand in thunder-storms,\\nAnd breed up warriors! See now, though yourself\\nBe dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs\\nThat swallow common sense, the spindling king,\\nThis Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.\\nWhen the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,\\nAnd topples down the scales; but this is fixt\\nAs are the roots of earth and base of all;\\nMan for the field and woman for the hearth:\\nMan for the sword and for the needle she:\\nMan with the head and woman with the heart:\\nMan to command and woman to obey;\\nAll else confusion. Look you! the gray mare\\nIs ill to live with, when her whinny shrills\\nFrom tile to scullery, and her small goodman\\nShrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell\\nMix with his hearth: but you--she\\'s yet a colt--\\nTake, break her: strongly groomed and straitly curbed\\nShe might not rank with those detestable\\nThat let the bantling scald at home, and brawl\\nTheir rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.\\nThey say she\\'s comely; there\\'s the fairer chance:\\n~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!\\nBesides, the woman wed is not as we,\\nBut suffers change of frame. A lusty brace\\nOf twins may weed her of her folly. Boy,\\nThe bearing and the training of a child\\nIs woman\\'s wisdom.\\'\\nThus the hard old king:\\nI took my leave, for it was nearly noon:\\nI pored upon her letter which I held,\\nAnd on the little clause \\'take not his life:\\'\\nI mused on that wild morning in the woods,\\nAnd on the \\'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:\\'\\nI thought on all the wrathful king had said,\\nAnd how the strange betrothment was to end:\\nThen I remembered that burnt sorcerer\\'s curse\\nThat one should fight with shadows and should fall;\\nAnd like a flash the weird affection came:\\nKing, camp and college turned to hollow shows;\\nI seemed to move in old memorial tilts,\\nAnd doing battle with forgotten ghosts,\\nTo dream myself the shadow of a dream:\\nAnd ere I woke it was the point of noon,\\nThe lists were ready. Empanoplied and plumed\\nWe entered in, and waited, fifty there\\nOpposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared\\nAt the barrier like a wild horn in a land\\nOf echoes, and a moment, and once more\\nThe trumpet, and again: at which the storm\\nOf galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears\\nAnd riders front to front, until they closed\\nIn conflict with the crash of shivering points,\\nAnd thunder. Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed\\nOf fighting. On his haunches rose the steed,\\nAnd into fiery splinters leapt the lance,\\nAnd out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.\\nPart sat like rocks: part reeled but kept their seats:\\nPart rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:\\nPart stumbled mixt with floundering horses. Down\\nFrom those two bulks at Arac\\'s side, and down\\nFrom Arac\\'s arm, as from a giant\\'s flail,\\nThe large blows rained, as here and everywhere\\nHe rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,\\nAnd all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--\\nShocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged\\nWith hammers; till I thought, can this be he\\nFrom Gama\\'s dwarfish loins? if this be so,\\nThe mother makes us most--and in my dream\\nI glanced aside, and saw the palace-front\\nAlive with fluttering scarfs and ladies\\' eyes,\\nAnd highest, among the statues, statuelike,\\nBetween a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,\\nWith Psyche\\'s babe, was Ida watching us,\\nA single band of gold about her hair,\\nLike a Saint\\'s glory up in heaven: but she\\nNo saint--inexorable--no tenderness--\\nToo hard, too cruel: yet she sees me fight,\\nYea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave\\nAmong the thickest and bore down a Prince,\\nAnd Cyril, one. Yea, let me make my dream\\nAll that I would. But that large-moulded man,\\nHis visage all agrin as at a wake,\\nMade at me through the press, and, staggering back\\nWith stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came\\nAs comes a pillar of electric cloud,\\nFlaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,\\nAnd shadowing down the champaign till it strikes\\nOn a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,\\nAnd twists the grain with such a roar that Earth\\nReels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything\\nGame way before him: only Florian, he\\nThat loved me closer than his own right eye,\\nThrust in between; but Arac rode him down:\\nAnd Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,\\nWith Psyche\\'s colour round his helmet, tough,\\nStrong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;\\nBut tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote\\nAnd threw him: last I spurred; I felt my veins\\nStretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,\\nAnd sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,\\nTill I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,\\nI did but shear a feather, and dream and truth\\nFlowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.\\n\\nHome they brought her warrior dead:\\nShe nor swooned, nor uttered cry:\\nAll her maidens, watching, said,\\n\\'She must weep or she will die.\\'\\n\\nThen they praised him, soft and low,\\nCalled him worthy to be loved,\\nTruest friend and noblest foe;\\nYet she neither spoke nor moved.\\n\\nStole a maiden from her place,\\nLightly to the warrior stept,\\nTook the face-cloth from the face;\\nYet she neither moved nor wept.\\n\\nRose a nurse of ninety years,\\nSet his child upon her knee--\\nLike summer tempest came her tears--\\n\\'Sweet my child, I live for thee.\\'\\n\\nVI\\n\\nMy dream had never died or lived again.\\nAs in some mystic middle state I lay;\\nSeeing I saw not, hearing not I heard:\\nThough, if I saw not, yet they told me all\\nSo often that I speak as having seen.\\n\\nFor so it seemed, or so they said to me,\\nThat all things grew more tragic and more strange;\\nThat when our side was vanquished and my cause\\nFor ever lost, there went up a great cry,\\nThe Prince is slain. My father heard and ran\\nIn on the lists, and there unlaced my casque\\nAnd grovelled on my body, and after him\\nCame Psyche, sorrowing for Aglaïa.\\nBut high upon the palace Ida stood\\nWith Psyche\\'s babe in arm: there on the roofs\\nLike that great dame of Lapidoth she sang.\\n\\n\\'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: the seed,\\nThe little seed they laughed at in the dark,\\nHas risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk\\nOf spanless girth, that lays on every side\\nA thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.\\n\\n\\'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came;\\nThe leaves were wet with women\\'s tears: they heard\\nA noise of songs they would not understand:\\nThey marked it with the red cross to the fall,\\nAnd would have strown it, and are fallen themselves.\\n\\n\\'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came,\\nThe woodmen with their axes: lo the tree!\\nBut we will make it faggots for the hearth,\\nAnd shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,\\nAnd boats and bridges for the use of men.\\n\\n\\'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they struck;\\nWith their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew\\nThere dwelt an iron nature in the grain:\\nThe glittering axe was broken in their arms,\\nTheir arms were shattered to the shoulder blade.\\n\\n\\'Our enemies have fallen, but this shall grow\\nA night of Summer from the heat, a breadth\\nOf Autumn, dropping fruits of power: and rolled\\nWith music in the growing breeze of Time,\\nThe tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs\\nShall move the stony bases of the world.\\n\\n\\'And now, O maids, behold our sanctuary\\nIs violate, our laws broken: fear we not\\nTo break them more in their behoof, whose arms\\nChampioned our cause and won it with a day\\nBlanched in our annals, and perpetual feast,\\nWhen dames and heroines of the golden year\\nShall strip a hundred hollows bare of Spring,\\nTo rain an April of ovation round\\nTheir statues, borne aloft, the three: but come,\\nWe will be liberal, since our rights are won.\\nLet them not lie in the tents with coarse mankind,\\nIll nurses; but descend, and proffer these\\nThe brethren of our blood and cause, that there\\nLie bruised and maimed, the tender ministries\\nOf female hands and hospitality.\\'\\n\\nShe spoke, and with the babe yet in her arms,\\nDescending, burst the great bronze valves, and led\\nA hundred maids in train across the Park.\\nSome cowled, and some bare-headed, on they came,\\nTheir feet in flowers, her loveliest: by them went\\nThe enamoured air sighing, and on their curls\\nFrom the high tree the blossom wavering fell,\\nAnd over them the tremulous isles of light\\nSlided, they moving under shade: but Blanche\\nAt distance followed: so they came: anon\\nThrough open field into the lists they wound\\nTimorously; and as the leader of the herd\\nThat holds a stately fretwork to the Sun,\\nAnd followed up by a hundred airy does,\\nSteps with a tender foot, light as on air,\\nThe lovely, lordly creature floated on\\nTo where her wounded brethren lay; there stayed;\\nKnelt on one knee,--the child on one,--and prest\\nTheir hands, and called them dear deliverers,\\nAnd happy warriors, and immortal names,\\nAnd said \\'You shall not lie in the tents but here,\\nAnd nursed by those for whom you fought, and served\\nWith female hands and hospitality.\\'\\n\\nThen, whether moved by this, or was it chance,\\nShe past my way. Up started from my side\\nThe old lion, glaring with his whelpless eye,\\nSilent; but when she saw me lying stark,\\nDishelmed and mute, and motionlessly pale,\\nCold even to her, she sighed; and when she saw\\nThe haggard father\\'s face and reverend beard\\nOf grisly twine, all dabbled with the blood\\nOf his own son, shuddered, a twitch of pain\\nTortured her mouth, and o\\'er her forehead past\\nA shadow, and her hue changed, and she said:\\n\\'He saved my life: my brother slew him for it.\\'\\nNo more: at which the king in bitter scorn\\nDrew from my neck the painting and the tress,\\nAnd held them up: she saw them, and a day\\nRose from the distance on her memory,\\nWhen the good Queen, her mother, shore the tress\\nWith kisses, ere the days of Lady Blanche:\\nAnd then once more she looked at my pale face:\\nTill understanding all the foolish work\\nOf Fancy, and the bitter close of all,\\nHer iron will was broken in her mind;\\nHer noble heart was molten in her breast;\\nShe bowed, she set the child on the earth; she laid\\nA feeling finger on my brows, and presently\\n\\'O Sire,\\' she said, \\'he lives: he is not dead:\\nO let me have him with my brethren here\\nIn our own palace: we will tend on him\\nLike one of these; if so, by any means,\\nTo lighten this great clog of thanks, that make\\nOur progress falter to the woman\\'s goal.\\'\\n\\nShe said: but at the happy word \\'he lives\\'\\nMy father stooped, re-fathered o\\'er my wounds.\\nSo those two foes above my fallen life,\\nWith brow to brow like night and evening mixt\\nTheir dark and gray, while Psyche ever stole\\nA little nearer, till the babe that by us,\\nHalf-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,\\nLay like a new-fallen meteor on the grass,\\nUncared for, spied its mother and began\\nA blind and babbling laughter, and to dance\\nIts body, and reach its fatling innocent arms\\nAnd lazy lingering fingers. She the appeal\\nBrooked not, but clamouring out \\'Mine--mine--not yours,\\nIt is not yours, but mine: give me the child\\'\\nCeased all on tremble: piteous was the cry:\\nSo stood the unhappy mother open-mouthed,\\nAnd turned each face her way: wan was her cheek\\nWith hollow watch, her blooming mantle torn,\\nRed grief and mother\\'s hunger in her eye,\\nAnd down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half\\nThe sacred mother\\'s bosom, panting, burst\\nThe laces toward her babe; but she nor cared\\nNor knew it, clamouring on, till Ida heard,\\nLooked up, and rising slowly from me, stood\\nErect and silent, striking with her glance\\nThe mother, me, the child; but he that lay\\nBeside us, Cyril, battered as he was,\\nTrailed himself up on one knee: then he drew\\nHer robe to meet his lips, and down she looked\\nAt the armed man sideways, pitying as it seemed,\\nOr self-involved; but when she learnt his face,\\nRemembering his ill-omened song, arose\\nOnce more through all her height, and o\\'er him grew\\nTall as a figure lengthened on the sand\\nWhen the tide ebbs in sunshine, and he said:\\n\\n\\'O fair and strong and terrible! Lioness\\nThat with your long locks play the Lion\\'s mane!\\nBut Love and Nature, these are two more terrible\\nAnd stronger. See, your foot is on our necks,\\nWe vanquished, you the Victor of your will.\\nWhat would you more? Give her the child! remain\\nOrbed in your isolation: he is dead,\\nOr all as dead: henceforth we let you be:\\nWin you the hearts of women; and beware\\nLest, where you seek the common love of these,\\nThe common hate with the revolving wheel\\nShould drag you down, and some great Nemesis\\nBreak from a darkened future, crowned with fire,\\nAnd tread you out for ever: but howso\\'er\\nFixed in yourself, never in your own arms\\nTo hold your own, deny not hers to her,\\nGive her the child! O if, I say, you keep\\nOne pulse that beats true woman, if you loved\\nThe breast that fed or arm that dandled you,\\nOr own one port of sense not flint to prayer,\\nGive her the child! or if you scorn to lay it,\\nYourself, in hands so lately claspt with yours,\\nOr speak to her, your dearest, her one fault,\\nThe tenderness, not yours, that could not kill,\\nGive ~me~ it: ~I~ will give it her.\\nHe said:\\nAt first her eye with slow dilation rolled\\nDry flame, she listening; after sank and sank\\nAnd, into mournful twilight mellowing, dwelt\\nFull on the child; she took it: \\'Pretty bud!\\nLily of the vale! half opened bell of the woods!\\nSole comfort of my dark hour, when a world\\nOf traitorous friend and broken system made\\nNo purple in the distance, mystery,\\nPledge of a love not to be mine, farewell;\\nThese men are hard upon us as of old,\\nWe two must part: and yet how fain was I\\nTo dream thy cause embraced in mine, to think\\nI might be something to thee, when I felt\\nThy helpless warmth about my barren breast\\nIn the dead prime: but may thy mother prove\\nAs true to thee as false, false, false to me!\\nAnd, if thou needs must needs bear the yoke, I wish it\\nGentle as freedom\\'--here she kissed it: then--\\n\\'All good go with thee! take it Sir,\\' and so\\nLaid the soft babe in his hard-mailèd hands,\\nWho turned half-round to Psyche as she sprang\\nTo meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks;\\nThen felt it sound and whole from head to foot,\\nAnd hugged and never hugged it close enough,\\nAnd in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it,\\nAnd hid her bosom with it; after that\\nPut on more calm and added suppliantly:\\n\\n\\'We two were friends: I go to mine own land\\nFor ever: find some other: as for me\\nI scarce am fit for your great plans: yet speak to me,\\nSay one soft word and let me part forgiven.\\'\\n\\nBut Ida spoke not, rapt upon the child.\\nThen Arac. \\'Ida--\\'sdeath! you blame the man;\\nYou wrong yourselves--the woman is so hard\\nUpon the woman. Come, a grace to me!\\nI am your warrior: I and mine have fought\\nYour battle: kiss her; take her hand, she weeps:\\n\\'Sdeath! I would sooner fight thrice o\\'er than see it.\\'\\n\\nBut Ida spoke not, gazing on the ground,\\nAnd reddening in the furrows of his chin,\\nAnd moved beyond his custom, Gama said:\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve heard that there is iron in the blood,\\nAnd I believe it. Not one word? not one?\\nWhence drew you this steel temper? not from me,\\nNot from your mother, now a saint with saints.\\nShe said you had a heart--I heard her say it--\\n\"Our Ida has a heart\"--just ere she died--\\n\"But see that some on with authority\\nBe near her still\" and I--I sought for one--\\nAll people said she had authority--\\nThe Lady Blanche: much profit! Not one word;\\nNo! though your father sues: see how you stand\\nStiff as Lot\\'s wife, and all the good knights maimed,\\nI trust that there is no one hurt to death,\\nFor our wild whim: and was it then for this,\\nWas it for this we gave our palace up,\\nWhere we withdrew from summer heats and state,\\nAnd had our wine and chess beneath the planes,\\nAnd many a pleasant hour with her that\\'s gone,\\nEre you were born to vex us? Is it kind?\\nSpeak to her I say: is this not she of whom,\\nWhen first she came, all flushed you said to me\\nNow had you got a friend of your own age,\\nNow could you share your thought; now should men see\\nTwo women faster welded in one love\\nThan pairs of wedlock; she you walked with, she\\nYou talked with, whole nights long, up in the tower,\\nOf sine and arc, spheroïd and azimuth,\\nAnd right ascension, Heaven knows what; and now\\nA word, but one, one little kindly word,\\nNot one to spare her: out upon you, flint!\\nYou love nor her, nor me, nor any; nay,\\nYou shame your mother\\'s judgment too. Not one?\\nYou will not? well--no heart have you, or such\\nAs fancies like the vermin in a nut\\nHave fretted all to dust and bitterness.\\'\\nSo said the small king moved beyond his won\\'t.\\n\\nBut Ida stood nor spoke, drained of her force\\nBy many a varying influence and so long.\\nDown through her limbs a drooping languor wept:\\nHer head a little bent; and on her mouth\\nA doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon\\nIn a still water: then brake out my sire,\\nLifted his grim head from my wounds. \\'O you,\\nWoman, whom we thought woman even now,\\nAnd were half fooled to let you tend our son,\\nBecause he might have wished it--but we see,\\nThe accomplice of your madness unforgiven,\\nAnd think that you might mix his draught with death,\\nWhen your skies change again: the rougher hand\\nIs safer: on to the tents: take up the Prince.\\'\\n\\nHe rose, and while each ear was pricked to attend\\nA tempest, through the cloud that dimmed her broke\\nA genial warmth and light once more, and shone\\nThrough glittering drops on her sad friend.\\n\\'Come hither.\\nO Psyche,\\' she cried out, \\'embrace me, come,\\nQuick while I melt; make reconcilement sure\\nWith one that cannot keep her mind an hour:\\nCome to the hollow hear they slander so!\\nKiss and be friends, like children being chid!\\n~I~ seem no more: ~I~ want forgiveness too:\\nI should have had to do with none but maids,\\nThat have no links with men. Ah false but dear,\\nDear traitor, too much loved, why?--why?--Yet see,\\nBefore these kings we embrace you yet once more\\nWith all forgiveness, all oblivion,\\nAnd trust, not love, you less.\\nAnd now, O sire,\\nGrant me your son, to nurse, to wait upon him,\\nLike mine own brother. For my debt to him,\\nThis nightmare weight of gratitude, I know it;\\nTaunt me no more: yourself and yours shall have\\nFree adit; we will scatter all our maids\\nTill happier times each to her proper hearth:\\nWhat use to keep them here--now? grant my prayer.\\nHelp, father, brother, help; speak to the king:\\nThaw this male nature to some touch of that\\nWhich kills me with myself, and drags me down\\nFrom my fixt height to mob me up with all\\nThe soft and milky rabble of womankind,\\nPoor weakling even as they are.\\'\\nPassionate tears\\nFollowed: the king replied not: Cyril said:\\n\\'Your brother, Lady,--Florian,--ask for him\\nOf your great head--for he is wounded too--\\nThat you may tend upon him with the prince.\\'\\n\\'Ay so,\\' said Ida with a bitter smile,\\n\\'Our laws are broken: let him enter too.\\'\\nThen Violet, she that sang the mournful song,\\nAnd had a cousin tumbled on the plain,\\nPetitioned too for him. \\'Ay so,\\' she said,\\n\\'I stagger in the stream: I cannot keep\\nMy heart an eddy from the brawling hour:\\nWe break our laws with ease, but let it be.\\'\\n\\'Ay so?\\' said Blanche: \\'Amazed am I to her\\nYour Highness: but your Highness breaks with ease\\nThe law your Highness did not make: \\'twas I.\\nI had been wedded wife, I knew mankind,\\nAnd blocked them out; but these men came to woo\\nYour Highness--verily I think to win.\\'\\n\\nSo she, and turned askance a wintry eye:\\nBut Ida with a voice, that like a bell\\nTolled by an earthquake in a trembling tower,\\nRang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.\\n\\n\\'Fling our doors wide! all, all, not one, but all,\\nNot only he, but by my mother\\'s soul,\\nWhatever man lies wounded, friend or foe,\\nShall enter, if he will. Let our girls flit,\\nTill the storm die! but had you stood by us,\\nThe roar that breaks the Pharos from his base\\nHad left us rock. She fain would sting us too,\\nBut shall not. Pass, and mingle with your likes.\\nWe brook no further insult but are gone.\\'\\nShe turned; the very nape of her white neck\\nWas rosed with indignation: but the Prince\\nHer brother came; the king her father charmed\\nHer wounded soul with words: nor did mine own\\nRefuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.\\n\\nThen us they lifted up, dead weights, and bare\\nStraight to the doors: to them the doors gave way\\nGroaning, and in the Vestal entry shrieked\\nThe virgin marble under iron heels:\\nAnd on they moved and gained the hall, and there\\nRested: but great the crush was, and each base,\\nTo left and right, of those tall columns drowned\\nIn silken fluctuation and the swarm\\nOf female whisperers: at the further end\\nWas Ida by the throne, the two great cats\\nClose by her, like supporters on a shield,\\nBow-backed with fear: but in the centre stood\\nThe common men with rolling eyes; amazed\\nThey glared upon the women, and aghast\\nThe women stared at these, all silent, save\\nWhen armour clashed or jingled, while the day,\\nDescending, struck athwart the hall, and shot\\nA flying splendour out of brass and steel,\\nThat o\\'er the statues leapt from head to head,\\nNow fired an angry Pallas on the helm,\\nNow set a wrathful Dian\\'s moon on flame,\\nAnd now and then an echo started up,\\nAnd shuddering fled from room to room, and died\\nOf fright in far apartments.\\nThen the voice\\nOf Ida sounded, issuing ordinance:\\nAnd me they bore up the broad stairs, and through\\nThe long-laid galleries past a hundred doors\\nTo one deep chamber shut from sound, and due\\nTo languid limbs and sickness; left me in it;\\nAnd others otherwhere they laid; and all\\nThat afternoon a sound arose of hoof\\nAnd chariot, many a maiden passing home\\nTill happier times; but some were left of those\\nHeld sagest, and the great lords out and in,\\nFrom those two hosts that lay beside the walls,\\nWalked at their will, and everything was changed.\\n\\nAsk me no more: the moon may draw the sea;\\nThe cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape\\nWith fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;\\nBut O too fond, when have I answered thee?\\nAsk me no more.\\n\\nAsk me no more: what answer should I give?\\nI love not hollow cheek or faded eye:\\nYet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!\\nAsk me no more, lest I should bid thee live;\\nAsk me no more.\\n\\nAsk me no more: thy fate and mine are sealed:\\nI strove against the stream and all in vain:\\nLet the great river take me to the main:\\nNo more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;\\nAsk me no more.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nSo was their sanctuary violated,\\nSo their fair college turned to hospital;\\nAt first with all confusion: by and by\\nSweet order lived again with other laws:\\nA kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere\\nLow voices with the ministering hand\\nHung round the sick: the maidens came, they talked,\\nThey sang, they read: till she not fair began\\nTo gather light, and she that was, became\\nHer former beauty treble; and to and fro\\nWith books, with flowers, with Angel offices,\\nLike creatures native unto gracious act,\\nAnd in their own clear element, they moved.\\n\\nBut sadness on the soul of Ida fell,\\nAnd hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.\\nOld studies failed; seldom she spoke: but oft\\nClomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours\\nOn that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men\\nDarkening her female field: void was her use,\\nAnd she as one that climbs a peak to gaze\\nO\\'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud\\nDrag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,\\nBlot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,\\nAnd suck the blinding splendour from the sand,\\nAnd quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn\\nExpunge the world: so fared she gazing there;\\nSo blackened all her world in secret, blank\\nAnd waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,\\nAnd found fair peace once more among the sick.\\n\\nAnd twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark\\nShot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I\\nLay silent in the muffled cage of life:\\nAnd twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers\\nDrew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,\\nStar after Star, arose and fell; but I,\\nDeeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay\\nQuite sundered from the moving Universe,\\nNor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand\\nThat nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.\\n\\nBut Psyche tended Florian: with her oft,\\nMelissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left\\nHer child among us, willing she should keep\\nCourt-favour: here and there the small bright head,\\nA light of healing, glanced about the couch,\\nOr through the parted silks the tender face\\nPeeped, shining in upon the wounded man\\nWith blush and smile, a medicine in themselves\\nTo wile the length from languorous hours, and draw\\nThe sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon\\nHe rose up whole, and those fair charities\\nJoined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears\\nSo gentle, so employed, should close in love,\\nThan when two dewdrops on the petals shake\\nTo the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,\\nAnd slip at once all-fragrant into one.\\n\\nLess prosperously the second suit obtained\\nAt first with Psyche. Not though Blanche had sworn\\nThat after that dark night among the fields\\nShe needs must wed him for her own good name;\\nNot though he built upon the babe restored;\\nNor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared\\nTo incense the Head once more; till on a day\\nWhen Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind\\nSeen but of Psyche: on her foot she hung\\nA moment, and she heard, at which her face\\nA little flushed, and she past on; but each\\nAssumed from thence a half-consent involved\\nIn stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.\\n\\nNor only these: Love in the sacred halls\\nHeld carnival at will, and flying struck\\nWith showers of random sweet on maid and man.\\nNor did her father cease to press my claim,\\nNor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet\\nDid those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;\\nNor Arac, satiate with his victory.\\n\\nBut I lay still, and with me oft she sat:\\nThen came a change; for sometimes I would catch\\nHer hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,\\nAnd fling it like a viper off, and shriek\\n\\'You are not Ida;\\' clasp it once again,\\nAnd call her Ida, though I knew her not,\\nAnd call her sweet, as if in irony,\\nAnd call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:\\nAnd still she feared that I should lose my mind,\\nAnd often she believed that I should die:\\nTill out of long frustration of her care,\\nAnd pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,\\nAnd watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks\\nThrobbed thunder through the palace floors, or called\\nOn flying Time from all their silver tongues--\\nAnd out of memories of her kindlier days,\\nAnd sidelong glances at my father\\'s grief,\\nAnd at the happy lovers heart in heart--\\nAnd out of hauntings of my spoken love,\\nAnd lonely listenings to my muttered dream,\\nAnd often feeling of the helpless hands,\\nAnd wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--\\nFrom all a closer interest flourished up,\\nTenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,\\nLove, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears\\nBy some cold morning glacier; frail at first\\nAnd feeble, all unconscious of itself,\\nBut such as gathered colour day by day.\\n\\nLast I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death\\nFor weakness: it was evening: silent light\\nSlept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought\\nTwo grand designs; for on one side arose\\nThe women up in wild revolt, and stormed\\nAt the Oppian Law. Titanic shapes, they crammed\\nThe forum, and half-crushed among the rest\\nA dwarf-like Cato cowered. On the other side\\nHortensia spoke against the tax; behind,\\nA train of dames: by axe and eagle sat,\\nWith all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,\\nAnd half the wolf\\'s-milk curdled in their veins,\\nThe fierce triumvirs; and before them paused\\nHortensia pleading: angry was her face.\\n\\nI saw the forms: I knew not where I was:\\nThey did but look like hollow shows; nor more\\nSweet Ida: palm to palm she sat: the dew\\nDwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape\\nAnd rounder seemed: I moved: I sighed: a touch\\nCame round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:\\nThen all for languor and self-pity ran\\nMine down my face, and with what life I had,\\nAnd like a flower that cannot all unfold,\\nSo drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,\\nYet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her\\nFixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:\\n\\n\\'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,\\nI would but ask you to fulfil yourself:\\nBut if you be that Ida whom I knew,\\nI ask you nothing: only, if a dream,\\nSweet dream, be perfect. I shall die tonight.\\nStoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.\\'\\n\\nI could no more, but lay like one in trance,\\nThat hears his burial talked of by his friends,\\nAnd cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,\\nBut lies and dreads his doom. She turned; she paused;\\nShe stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;\\nLeapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;\\nAnd I believed that in the living world\\nMy spirit closed with Ida\\'s at the lips;\\nTill back I fell, and from mine arms she rose\\nGlowing all over noble shame; and all\\nHer falser self slipt from her like a robe,\\nAnd left her woman, lovelier in her mood\\nThan in her mould that other, when she came\\nFrom barren deeps to conquer all with love;\\nAnd down the streaming crystal dropt; and she\\nFar-fleeted by the purple island-sides,\\nNaked, a double light in air and wave,\\nTo meet her Graces, where they decked her out\\nFor worship without end; nor end of mine,\\nStateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,\\nNor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,\\nFilled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.\\n\\nDeep in the night I woke: she, near me, held\\nA volume of the Poets of her land:\\nThere to herself, all in low tones, she read.\\n\\n\\'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;\\nNor waves the cypress in the palace walk;\\nNor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:\\nThe fire-fly wakens: wake thou with me.\\n\\nNow droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,\\nAnd like a ghost she glimmers on to me.\\n\\nNow lies the Earth all Danaë to the stars,\\nAnd all thy heart lies open unto me.\\n\\nNow lies the silent meteor on, and leaves\\nA shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.\\n\\nNow folds the lily all her sweetness up,\\nAnd slips into the bosom of the lake:\\nSo fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip\\nInto my bosom and be lost in me.\\'\\n\\nI heard her turn the page; she found a small\\nSweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:\\n\\n\\'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:\\nWhat pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)\\nIn height and cold, the splendour of the hills?\\nBut cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease\\nTo glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,\\nTo sit a star upon the sparkling spire;\\nAnd come, for love is of the valley, come,\\nFor love is of the valley, come thou down\\nAnd find him; by the happy threshold, he,\\nOr hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,\\nOr red with spirted purple of the vats,\\nOr foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk\\nWith Death and Morning on the silver horns,\\nNor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,\\nNor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,\\nThat huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls\\nTo roll the torrent out of dusky doors:\\nBut follow; let the torrent dance thee down\\nTo find him in the valley; let the wild\\nLean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave\\nThe monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill\\nTheir thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,\\nThat like a broken purpose waste in air:\\nSo waste not thou; but come; for all the vales\\nAwait thee; azure pillars of the hearth\\nArise to thee; the children call, and I\\nThy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,\\nSweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;\\nMyriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,\\nThe moan of doves in immemorial elms,\\nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.\\'\\n\\nSo she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay\\nListening; then looked. Pale was the perfect face;\\nThe bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek\\nSeemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,\\nAnd the voice trembled and the hand. She said\\nBrokenly, that she knew it, she had failed\\nIn sweet humility; had failed in all;\\nThat all her labour was but as a block\\nLeft in the quarry; but she still were loth,\\nShe still were loth to yield herself to one\\nThat wholly scorned to help their equal rights\\nAgainst the sons of men, and barbarous laws.\\nShe prayed me not to judge their cause from her\\nThat wronged it, sought far less for truth than power\\nIn knowledge: something wild within her breast,\\nA greater than all knowledge, beat her down.\\nAnd she had nursed me there from week to week:\\nMuch had she learnt in little time. In part\\nIt was ill counsel had misled the girl\\nTo vex true hearts: yet was she but a girl--\\n\\'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!\\nWhen comes another such? never, I think,\\nTill the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.\\'\\nHer voice\\nchoked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,\\nAnd her great heart through all the faultful Past\\nWent sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;\\nTill notice of a change in the dark world\\nWas lispt about the acacias, and a bird,\\nThat early woke to feed her little ones,\\nSent from a dewy breast a cry for light:\\nShe moved, and at her feet the volume fell.\\n\\n\\'Blame not thyself too much,\\' I said, \\'nor blame\\nToo much the sons of men and barbarous laws;\\nThese were the rough ways of the world till now.\\nHenceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know\\nThe woman\\'s cause is man\\'s: they rise or sink\\nTogether, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:\\nFor she that out of Lethe scales with man\\nThe shining steps of Nature, shares with man\\nHis nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,\\nStays all the fair young planet in her hands--\\nIf she be small, slight-natured, miserable,\\nHow shall men grow? but work no more alone!\\nOur place is much: as far as in us lies\\nWe two will serve them both in aiding her--\\nWill clear away the parasitic forms\\nThat seem to keep her up but drag her down--\\nWill leave her space to burgeon out of all\\nWithin her--let her make herself her own\\nTo give or keep, to live and learn and be\\nAll that not harms distinctive womanhood.\\nFor woman is not undevelopt man,\\nBut diverse: could we make her as the man,\\nSweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,\\nNot like to like, but like in difference.\\nYet in the long years liker must they grow;\\nThe man be more of woman, she of man;\\nHe gain in sweetness and in moral height,\\nNor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\\nShe mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\\nNor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\\nTill at the last she set herself to man,\\nLike perfect music unto noble words;\\nAnd so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,\\nSit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,\\nDispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,\\nSelf-reverent each and reverencing each,\\nDistinct in individualities,\\nBut like each other even as those who love.\\nThen comes the statelier Eden back to men:\\nThen reign the world\\'s great bridals, chaste and calm:\\nThen springs the crowning race of humankind.\\nMay these things be!\\'\\nSighing she spoke \\'I fear\\nThey will not.\\'\\n\\'Dear, but let us type them now\\nIn our own lives, and this proud watchword rest\\nOf equal; seeing either sex alone\\nIs half itself, and in true marriage lies\\nNor equal, nor unequal: each fulfils\\nDefect in each, and always thought in thought,\\nPurpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,\\nThe single pure and perfect animal,\\nThe two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,\\nLife.\\'\\nAnd again sighing she spoke: \\'A dream\\nThat once was mind! what woman taught you this?\\'\\n\\n\\'Alone,\\' I said, \\'from earlier than I know,\\nImmersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,\\nI loved the woman: he, that doth not, lives\\nA drowning life, besotted in sweet self,\\nOr pines in sad experience worse than death,\\nOr keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:\\nYet was there one through whom I loved her, one\\nNot learnèd, save in gracious household ways,\\nNot perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,\\nNo Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt\\nIn Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,\\nInterpreter between the Gods and men,\\nWho looked all native to her place, and yet\\nOn tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere\\nToo gross to tread, and all male minds perforce\\nSwayed to her from their orbits as they moved,\\nAnd girdled her with music. Happy he\\nWith such a mother! faith in womankind\\nBeats with his blood, and trust in all things high\\nComes easy to him, and though he trip and fall\\nHe shall not blind his soul with clay.\\'\\n\\'But I,\\'\\nSaid Ida, tremulously, \\'so all unlike--\\nIt seems you love to cheat yourself with words:\\nThis mother is your model. I have heard\\nof your strange doubts: they well might be: I seem\\nA mockery to my own self. Never, Prince;\\nYou cannot love me.\\'\\n\\'Nay but thee\\' I said\\n\\'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,\\nEre seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw\\nThee woman through the crust of iron moods\\nThat masked thee from men\\'s reverence up, and forced\\nSweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood: now,\\nGiven back to life, to life indeed, through thee,\\nIndeed I love: the new day comes, the light\\nDearer for night, as dearer thou for faults\\nLived over: lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,\\nMy haunting sense of hollow shows: the change,\\nThis truthful change in thee has killed it. Dear,\\nLook up, and let thy nature strike on mine,\\nLike yonder morning on the blind half-world;\\nApproach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;\\nIn that fine air I tremble, all the past\\nMelts mist-like into this bright hour, and this\\nIs morn to more, and all the rich to-come\\nReels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels\\nAthwart the smoke of burning weeds. Forgive me,\\nI waste my heart in signs: let be. My bride,\\nMy wife, my life. O we will walk this world,\\nYoked in all exercise of noble end,\\nAnd so through those dark gates across the wild\\nThat no man knows. Indeed I love thee: come,\\nYield thyself up: my hopes and thine are one:\\nAccomplish thou my manhood and thyself;\\nLay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.\\'\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSo closed our tale, of which I give you all\\nThe random scheme as wildly as it rose:\\nThe words are mostly mine; for when we ceased\\nThere came a minute\\'s pause, and Walter said,\\n\\'I wish she had not yielded!\\' then to me,\\n\\'What, if you drest it up poetically?\\'\\nSo prayed the men, the women: I gave assent:\\nYet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven\\nTogether in one sheaf? What style could suit?\\nThe men required that I should give throughout\\nThe sort of mock-heroic gigantesque,\\nWith which we bantered little Lilia first:\\nThe women--and perhaps they felt their power,\\nFor something in the ballads which they sang,\\nOr in their silent influence as they sat,\\nHad ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque,\\nAnd drove us, last, to quite a solemn close--\\nThey hated banter, wished for something real,\\nA gallant fight, a noble princess--why\\nNot make her true-heroic--true-sublime?\\nOr all, they said, as earnest as the close?\\nWhich yet with such a framework scarce could be.\\nThen rose a little feud betwixt the two,\\nBetwixt the mockers and the realists:\\nAnd I, betwixt them both, to please them both,\\nAnd yet to give the story as it rose,\\nI moved as in a strange diagonal,\\nAnd maybe neither pleased myself nor them.\\n\\nBut Lilia pleased me, for she took no part\\nIn our dispute: the sequel of the tale\\nHad touched her; and she sat, she plucked the grass,\\nShe flung it from her, thinking: last, she fixt\\nA showery glance upon her aunt, and said,\\n\\'You--tell us what we are\\' who might have told,\\nFor she was crammed with theories out of books,\\nBut that there rose a shout: the gates were closed\\nAt sunset, and the crowd were swarming now,\\nTo take their leave, about the garden rails.\\n\\nSo I and some went out to these: we climbed\\nThe slope to Vivian-place, and turning saw\\nThe happy valleys, half in light, and half\\nFar-shadowing from the west, a land of peace;\\nGray halls alone among their massive groves;\\nTrim hamlets; here and there a rustic tower\\nHalf-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat;\\nThe shimmering glimpses of a stream; the seas;\\nA red sail, or a white; and far beyond,\\nImagined more than seen, the skirts of France.\\n\\n\\'Look there, a garden!\\' said my college friend,\\nThe Tory member\\'s elder son, \\'and there!\\nGod bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,\\nAnd keeps our Britain, whole within herself,\\nA nation yet, the rulers and the ruled--\\nSome sense of duty, something of a faith,\\nSome reverence for the laws ourselves have made,\\nSome patient force to change them when we will,\\nSome civic manhood firm against the crowd--\\nBut yonder, whiff! there comes a sudden heat,\\nThe gravest citizen seems to lose his head,\\nThe king is scared, the soldier will not fight,\\nThe little boys begin to shoot and stab,\\nA kingdom topples over with a shriek\\nLike an old woman, and down rolls the world\\nIn mock heroics stranger than our own;\\nRevolts, republics, revolutions, most\\nNo graver than a schoolboys\\' barring out;\\nToo comic for the serious things they are,\\nToo solemn for the comic touches in them,\\nLike our wild Princess with as wise a dream\\nAs some of theirs--God bless the narrow seas!\\nI wish they were a whole Atlantic broad.\\'\\n\\n\\'Have patience,\\' I replied, \\'ourselves are full\\nOf social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams\\nAre but the needful preludes of the truth:\\nFor me, the genial day, the happy crowd,\\nThe sport half-science, fill me with a faith.\\nThis fine old world of ours is but a child\\nYet in the go-cart. Patience! Give it time\\nTo learn its limbs: there is a hand that guides.\\'\\n\\nIn such discourse we gained the garden rails,\\nAnd there we saw Sir Walter where he stood,\\nBefore a tower of crimson holly-hoaks,\\nAmong six boys, head under head, and looked\\nNo little lily-handed Baronet he,\\nA great broad-shouldered genial Englishman,\\nA lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,\\nA raiser of huge melons and of pine,\\nA patron of some thirty charities,\\nA pamphleteer on guano and on grain,\\nA quarter-sessions chairman, abler none;\\nFair-haired and redder than a windy morn;\\nNow shaking hands with him, now him, of those\\nThat stood the nearest--now addressed to speech--\\nWho spoke few words and pithy, such as closed\\nWelcome, farewell, and welcome for the year\\nTo follow: a shout rose again, and made\\nThe long line of the approaching rookery swerve\\nFrom the elms, and shook the branches of the deer\\nFrom slope to slope through distant ferns, and rang\\nBeyond the bourn of sunset; O, a shout\\nMore joyful than the city-roar that hails\\nPremier or king! Why should not these great Sirs\\nGive up their parks some dozen times a year\\nTo let the people breathe? So thrice they cried,\\nI likewise, and in groups they streamed away.\\n\\nBut we went back to the Abbey, and sat on,\\nSo much the gathering darkness charmed: we sat\\nBut spoke not, rapt in nameless reverie,\\nPerchance upon the future man: the walls\\nBlackened about us, bats wheeled, and owls whooped,\\nAnd gradually the powers of the night,\\nThat range above the region of the wind,\\nDeepening the courts of twilight broke them up\\nThrough all the silent spaces of the worlds,\\nBeyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens.\\n\\nLast little Lilia, rising quietly,\\nDisrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph\\nFrom those rich silks, and home well-pleased we went.1Embed']"
